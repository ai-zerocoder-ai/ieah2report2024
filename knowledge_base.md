Abstract 
The Global Hydrogen Review is an annual publication by the International Energy Agency that tracks hydrogen production and demand worldwide, as well as 
progress in critical areas such as infrastructure development, trade, policy, regulation, investments and innovation. 
The report is an output of the Clean Energy Ministerial Hydrogen Initiative and is intended to inform energy sector stakeholders on the status and future prospects of hydrogen. Focusing on hydrogen’s potential role in meeting international energy and climate goals, the Review aims to help decision makers fine-tune strategies to attract investment and facilitate deployment of hydrogen technologies at the same time as creating demand for hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. It compares real-world developments with the stated ambitions of government and industry. 
This year’s report has a special focus on Latin America and includes analysis on recent developments of low-emissions hydrogen projects in the region and how to unlock demand and move towards project implementation. In addition, the report assesses in detail the greenhouse gas emissions associated with different hydrogen supply chains.

Executive summary 
More projects and more final investment decisions, but setbacks persist Global hydrogen demand reached 97 Mt in 2023, an increase of 2.5% compared 
to 2022. Demand remains concentrated in refining and the chemical sector, and is principally covered by hydrogen produced from unabated fossil fuels. As in 
previous years, low-emissions hydrogen played only a marginal role, with production of less than 1 Mt in 2023. However, low-emissions hydrogen 
production could reach 49 Mtpa by 2030 based on announced projects, almost 30% more than when the Global Hydrogen Review 2023 was released. This strong 
growth has been mostly driven by electrolysis projects, with announced electrolysis capacity amounting to almost 520 GW. The number of projects that 
have reached a final investment decision (FID) is also growing: Announced production that has taken FID doubled compared with last year to reach 3.4 Mtpa, 
representing a fivefold increase on today’s production by 2030. This is split roughly evenly between electrolysis (1.9 Mtpa) and fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) (1.5 Mtpa).  
Hydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS has gained ground over the past year – although the total potential production from announced projects grew only marginally compared with last year, there were several FIDs for previously announced large-scale projects, all of which are located in North America and Europe. As a result, the potential production in 2030 from projects using fossil fuels with CCUS that have taken FID more than doubled in the last year, from 0.6 Mtpa in September 2023 to 1.5 Mtpa today. 
Overall, this is noteworthy progress for a nascent sector, but most of the potential production is still in planning or at even earlier stages. For the full project pipeline to materialise, the sector would need to grow at an unprecedented compound annual growth rate of over 90% from 2024 until 2030, well above the growth experienced by solar PV during its fastest expansion phases. Several projects have faced delays and cancellations, which are putting at risk a significant part of the project pipeline. The main reasons include unclear demand signals, financing hurdles, delays to incentives, regulatory ncertainties, licensing and permitting issues and operational challenges.

China and electrolysers – the sequel to solar PV and batteries? 
Announced electrolyser capacity that has reached FID now stands at 20 GW globally, of which 6.5 GW reached FID over the last 12 months alone. China is 
strengthening its leadership, accounting for more than 40% of global FIDs in capacity terms over the same period. China’s front-running position is backed by its strength in the mass manufacturing of clean energy technologies: it is home to 60% of global electrolyser manufacturing capacity. China’s continued expansion of manufacturing capacity is expected to drive down electrolyser costs, as has occurred with solar PV and battery manufacturing in the past. Moreover, several large Chinese manufacturers of solar panels have entered the business of manufacturing electrolysers, and today they account for around one-third of China’s electrolyser manufacturing capacity. However, other regions are also stepping up efforts: in Europe, FIDs for electrolysis projects quadrupled over the last year to reach more than 2 GW, while India has emerged as one of the key players thanks to a single FID for 1.3 GW.

Technology innovation is making headway, with signs pointing to accelerated progress in the near term Government investment in hydrogen technology RD&D has been growing since 2016, and this effort is starting to bear fruit. To date, progress has occurred mostly on the supply side, and numerous technologies are either already commercially available or close to this point. Promising results are also being seen for end-use technologies, with several applications in industry and electricity generation reaching demonstration stage, as well as significant progress in transport applications, particularly in the shipping sector. In addition, the number of patent applications leapt up 47% in 2022, with most of the growth coming from technologies that are primarily motivated by climate change concerns. Increased activity around patenting suggests that additional public funding for R&D and growing confidence in future market opportunities, backed by supportive policies, are stimulating more new ideas and product designs with commercial potential.  
Low-emissions hydrogen will remain expensive in the short term, but costs are expected to fall significantly. Low-emissions hydrogen is an emerging sector and, as such, there is uncertainty about costs. Today’s electrolyser costs have been revised upwards for this report, based on newly available data from more advanced projects. The future cost evolution will depend on numerous factors, such as technology development, and particularly on the level and pace of deployment. With the deployment seen in the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), the cost of low-emissions hydrogen production from renewable electricity falls to USD 2-9/kg H2 by 2030 – half of today’s value – with the cost gap with unabated fossil-based production shrinking from USD 1.5-8/kg H2 today to USD 1-3/kg H2 by 2030. 
Deployment levels in the Stated Policies Scenario (which considers existing policies only) mean that the cost range would fall only around 30%. As natural gas prices fall in many regions, low-emissions hydrogen production from natural gas with CCUS is also set to experience cost reductions. 
Cost reductions will benefit all projects, but the impact on the competitiveness of individual projects will vary. For example, full development of the entire electrolyser project pipeline of almost 520 GW would achieve similar global cost reductions as in the NZE Scenario. In China, global deployment at such a level would mean that the vast majority of the production from its current electrolyser project pipeline (1 Mtpa) would be cheaper than hydrogen produced from unabated coal. Globally, by 2030, more than 5 Mtpa could be produced at a cost competitive with production from unabated fossil fuels, and up to 12 Mtpa with a cost premium of USD 1.5/kg H2. 

PAGE | 12
This cost gap will remain an important challenge in the short term for project developers, but for final products for which hydrogen is an intermediate feedstock, the impact is likely to be manageable in many cases. The cost premium of low-emissions hydrogen production decreases along the value chain, meaning that consumers often see only a modest price increase in final products. For example, using steel produced with renewable hydrogen today in the production of electric vehicles (EVs) would increase the total price of an EV by around 1%.  
Progress is being made in creating demand for low-emissions hydrogen, but this still needs to scale up Efforts to stimulate demand for low-emissions hydrogen (and hydrogen-based fuels) are now gaining traction as governments begin implementing key policies (such as Carbon Contracts for Difference in Germany and the EU mandates in aviation and shipping). These measures have also triggered action on the industry side, with a growing number of offtake agreements signed and the launch of tenders to purchase low-emissions hydrogen. However, the overall scale of these efforts remains inadequate for hydrogen to contribute to meeting climate goals. 
Policies and targets for hydrogen demand set by governments add up to around 11 Mt in 2030, nearly 3 Mt lower than last year due to the downward revisions of some targets for hydrogen use in industry, transport and power generation. Yet the amount of low-emissions hydrogen production that has taken FID (3.4 Mtpa) or is already operational (0.7 Mtpa), at 4 Mtpa, is well below that level. The gap constitutes a call for action to industry and governments to facilitate offtake agreements that can help unlock investment on the supply side.  
At the same time, government policies and targets for demand are well behind the production targets by governments (which add up to 43 Mtpa in 2030) and are 
even lower than the potential supply that could be achieved from announced projects (49 Mtpa). Policy measures are still insufficient to create the level of 
demand needed to scale up production to meet government expectations. In addition, some more ambitious actions (like the EU targets in industry applications 
or the refining quotas in India) have not yet been translated into national legislation. Moreover, from the around USD 100 billion of policy support for low-emissions hydrogen adoption announced by governments over the past year, support on the supply side is 50% larger than on the demand side. Stronger 
government action will be needed to stimulate demand for low-emissions hydrogen as an essential requirement to underpin investments on the supply side. 
Industrial hubs, where low-emissions hydrogen could replace the existing large demand for hydrogen met today by unabated fossil fuels, remain an important 
untapped opportunity for governments to stimulate demand.

The next steps for certification and mutual recognition Governments are accelerating the development of regulations on the environmental attributes of low-emissions hydrogen, particularly regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Clear and predictable regulations can strengthen certainty for long-term investments. Yet these frameworks, and the associated certification schemes, remain unaligned across different regions, creating potential for market fragmentation. In response, at COP 28, 37 governments committed to mutual recognition of national certification schemes, while Latin America launched “CertHiLAC”, a regional certification framework. In addition, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has released a methodology for determining GHG emissions associated with hydrogen production, transport and conversion/reconversion. This will be the basis for a full standard expected by 2025 or 2026, which could serve as a common methodology to enable the mutual recognition of certificates. However, some questions related to the assessment of GHG emissions in hydrogen supply chains remain unresolved, such as how to account for emissions from the construction and manufacturing of production assets. In the case of fossil-based production, there is a need for better data on upstream and midstream emissions of fossil fuel supply available in national inventories in order to ensure robust assessment of the GHG emissions associated with these production routes. 
Hydrogen can be an opportunity for Latin America in the new energy economy, but is facing challenges. This year’s report includes a special focus on Latin America and the Caribbean, following the launch of the IEA’s Latin America Energy Outlook in 2023. Latin America is well-positioned to emerge as a major producer of low-emissions hydrogen, capitalising on its abundant natural and renewable energy resources and largely decarbonised electricity mix. Based on announced projects, by 2030, Latin America could produce more than 7 Mtpa of hydrogen with a carbon intensity below 3 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 (3-4 times lower than using unabated natural gas), in line with the requirements of several existing regulations around the world (e.g. the EU Taxonomy, Japan’s Hydrogen Society Promotion Act and the US Clean Hydrogen Production Standard). However, achieving this potential in full would require a significant increase in electricity generation capacity – equivalent to 20% of the region’s current power output – and substantial investments in enabling infrastructure, such as transmission lines. 
Many Latin American countries already have hydrogen strategies with a strong focus on export opportunities. However, these plans may need to be updated in 
light of uncertainty about the size of the global hydrogen market. At the global level, there has been no growth in announced projects linked to trade of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels in the past year, suggesting that project developers have instead focused on domestic opportunities. In the case of Latin America, these opportunities are mostly in refining and ammonia production, which offer immediate large-scale applications. In the case of ammonia, developing domestic production capacities would help to reduce import dependency for fertilisers in a region where agriculture makes a significant contribution to national gross domestic product.

As the market develops, new applications in steel, shipping and aviation will emerge, together with the establishment of hydrogen hubs. These hubs can open 
an opportunity to scale up hydrogen use and production for domestic needs, while also providing the opportunity to export hydrogen-based fuels, as well as materials produced with low-emissions hydrogen, such as hot briquetted iron, allowing countries that are today large exporters of iron ore, like Brazil, to develop new industrial capacities and scale up in the value chain. A phased approach to supply in the region, starting with smaller-scale projects, will help mitigate risks, reduce capital investment, and provide valuable experience for scaling up in the future. 
Infrastructure planning and development, especially in long-lead projects like power transmission, should begin immediately to support future hydrogen 
production. Recommendations Accelerate demand creation for low-emissions hydrogen by leveraging industrial hubs and public procurement Governments should take bolder action to stimulate demand for low-emissions hydrogen. The implementation of policies such as quotas, mandates and carbon contracts for difference has already started, but remains limited in geographical coverage and scale. Governments can capitalise on the opportunity offered by 
existing hydrogen users and high-value sectors such as steel, shipping and aviation, which are often co-located in industrial hubs. Pooling demand in these 
hubs can create scale and reduce offtake risks for producers. Additionally, making use of public procurement for final products that consume low-emissions hydrogen in their production, and encouraging the development of markets where consumers are willing to pay small premiums for low-emissions hydrogen-based 
products, can help drive early adoption.  
Support project developers to scale up low-emissions hydrogen production and drive cost reductions Governments should provide targeted support to project developers in the scale-up phase to bridge the cost gap between low-emissions hydrogen and unabated fossil-based hydrogen. Timely support is critical to unlock investment decisions, as experienced in Europe with a wave of FIDs after the confirmation of funding for 
 
PAGE | 15
several large projects. Governments should also provide long-term visibility over the level and form of support so developers have clarity over future business cases and can attract investors. While initial projects may require substantial financial backing, support levels will decrease as the sector matures and costs decline. In addition to grants and subsidies, governments can explore other policy options 
such as loan guarantees, export credit facilities, and public equity investments which can help to reduce investment risk and lower the cost of capital, which is crucial for these capital-intensive projects. 
Strengthen regulation and certification of environmental attributes for low-emissions hydrogen  
The release of the ISO methodology provides a standardised approach to assessing GHG emissions. It is now time for governments to implement clear 
regulations that set thresholds for acceptable emissions levels in hydrogen production. Ensuring regulatory consistency with the ISO methodology and 
forthcoming standards can facilitate global interoperability. However, in addition, governments should intensify efforts to assess and verify upstream emissions from fossil fuel supply, ensuring transparency by making this data accessible to market participants and the public.   
Identify opportunities to start developing hydrogen infrastructure  Governments should strengthen efforts to accelerate the development of hydrogen 
infrastructure to avoid further delays that risk slowing the scale-up of low-emissions hydrogen production and demand. Without timely infrastructure deployment, the link between supply and demand cannot be established, hindering market growth and creating uncertainty for both producers and consumers. Immediate action can include early planning, a focus on repurposing existing natural gas pipelines and storage facilities to minimise cost, streamlining regulatory frameworks to speed up permitting, and fostering cross-border co-operation on hydrogen networks. Public-private partnerships can also be leveraged to de-risk investments, ensuring that infrastructure keeps pace with hydrogen market development. 
Support emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) in expanding low-emissions hydrogen production and use EMDEs, particularly in regions such as Africa and Latin America, hold significant potential for low-cost, low-emissions hydrogen production. To unlock this potential, governments of advanced economies and multilateral development banks should provide targeted support, including grants and concessional financing, to address key challenges such as access to financing, which is a major barrier for project developers in EMDEs. Developing these projects can help to cover domestic needs, reduce import dependencies and potentially enable the export of hydrogen or hydrogen-based products like hot briquetted iron and fertilisers.

Chapter 1. Introduction 
Overview 
The global energy sector is experiencing a profound transformation as efforts to tackle climate change and bolster energy security drive the shift toward cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. In this evolving landscape, interest in low-emissions hydrogen has grown rapidly due to a combination of drivers. First, it is widely recognised as a key solution for decarbonising sectors where emissions are hard to abate and other options are limited, such as in heavy industry, shipping and aviation. Second, the recent global energy crisis has further accelerated the push for low-emissions hydrogen, thanks to its potential to enhance energy security; as a consequence of the crisis, governments have intensified their net zero emission commitments, integrating low-emissions hydrogen into their strategic plans. Third, several major economies have recently introduced new industrial policies in which hydrogen technologies are prominently featured. 
However, despite this progress, the adoption of low-emissions hydrogen is yet to take off and there are still significant challenges to be overcome to fully realise its potential. 
This fourth edition of the IEA Global Hydrogen Review assesses the advances within the hydrogen sector in the past year, focusing on the critical role of low-emissions hydrogen in the clean energy transition. By examining developments since the release of the Global Hydrogen Review 2023 (in September 2023) and pinpointing areas that need further attention, the report aims to guide governments, industries, and other stakeholders on the steps needed to ensure 
that hydrogen contributes effectively to a sustainable energy system. 
The report begins with an analysis of the current state of hydrogen use and production. While global hydrogen use is on the rise, it remains heavily 
concentrated in traditional applications like refining and the chemical industry, with most production still based on unabated fossil fuels. Low-emissions hydrogen production has grown marginally over the past 2 years. Project developers are slowly starting to take investment decisions, although they are still facing significant barriers. 
The report also assesses the situation of trade and infrastructure development. 
Several shipments of low-emissions hydrogen-based fuels, particularly ammonia, occurred last year; however, overall traded volumes remain small, and most 
projects are still in the early stages of development. Activities to develop hydrogen infrastructure remain concentrated on project announcements, with a very limited number of projects moving ahead to construction stage.

The Global Hydrogen Review also presents trends in investment and innovation in the hydrogen sector. 
Investment is growing, stimulated mostly by policy action, but it is still well below the levels needed for a successful energy transition. Progress in the development of key technologies is starting to accelerate as a result of the growing efforts made by governments to support innovation in the last decade. 
The parts of the report devoted to tracking developments conclude with a policy chapter that summarises the main new policies adopted since the previous edition of the Global Hydrogen Review. 
Finally, this year’s Global Hydrogen Review includes two special focus chapters. The first presents an update of the analysis on the GHG emissions of hydrogen production following the IEA report on this topic for the G7 in 2023. We have reassessed the different production routes with the framework established by the ISO Technical Specification 19870:2023 and have extended the analysis to cover the whole supply chain of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. The second special thematic chapter is a regional focus on Latin America and the Caribbean, assessing the best short-term opportunities for the region to develop supply chains for low-emissions hydrogen, hydrogen-based fuels and other hydrogen-based products. 
The CEM Hydrogen Initiative 
Developed under the Clean Energy Ministerial framework, the Hydrogen Initiative (H2I) is a voluntary multi-governmental initiative that aims to advance policies, programmes and projects that accelerate the commercialisation and deployment of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies across all areas of the economy. The IEA serves as the H2I co-ordinator to support member governments as they develop activities aligned with the initiative. H2I currently comprises the following participating governments and intergovernmental entities: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”), Costa Rica, the European Commission, Finland, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, the Republic of Korea (hereafter “Korea”), Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States. Canada, the European Commission, Japan, the Netherlands and the United States co-lead the initiative, while China and Italy are observers. 
H2I is also a platform to co-ordinate and facilitate co-operation among governments, other international initiatives and the industry sector. H2I has active 
partnerships with the Breakthrough Agenda, the Hydrogen Council, the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE), the 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Mission Innovation Clean

Hydrogen Mission, the World Economic Forum, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and the IEA Advanced Fuel Cells and 
Hydrogen Technology Collaboration Programmes (TCPs), all of which are part of the H2I Advisory Group and participate in various activities of the H2I. In addition, several industrial partners actively participate in the H2I Advisory Group’s biannual meetings, including Ballard, Enel, Engie, Nel Hydrogen, the Port of Rotterdam Authority and thyssenkrupp nucera.

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
Highlights 
 Global hydrogen demand reached more than 97 Mt in 2023 and could reach almost 100 Mt in 2024. However, this increase should be seen as a consequence of wider economic trends rather than the result of successful policy implementation. 
 Hydrogen demand remains concentrated in refining and industry applications, where it has been used for decades. Its adoption in new applications where 
hydrogen should play a key role in the clean energy transition – heavy industry, long-distance transport and energy storage – accounts for less than 1% of global demand, despite 40% growth compared with 2022. 
 Demand for low-emissions hydrogen grew almost 10% in 2023, but still accounts for less than 1 Mt. Government action has intensified recently, through 
implementation of mandates, incentive schemes and market development tools. This could boost demand to over 6 Mtpa by 2030, although this would equal around 
one-tenth of the needs of the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario). 
 Industry is responding to these policy efforts and signing a growing number of offtake agreements. Moreover, these agreements are moving from Memoranda of 
Understanding to firm contractual arrangements. Chemical, refining and the shipping sectors present the largest amount of contracted demand, as well as the 
largest share of firm agreements. 
 Industry is also making other efforts to facilitate uptake, such as tenders and co-operative initiatives for demand aggregation of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels and feedstocks. 
 Several large-scale projects for the production of low-emissions hydrogen for use in refining, chemicals production and steel manufacturing reached final investment decisions (FID) last year. The committed projects in these sectors could lead to a demand for 1.5 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen by 2030, 3 times more than today. 
 There are contrasting trends in different transport subsectors. In road transport, the market is slowing down, with the focus shifting from cars to heavy-duty vehicles. In shipping and aviation, the use of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels is gaining interest, especially where policy support is in place, though slow market penetration has led to the cancellation of some ambitious projects for the supply of these fuels. 
 In the power sector, progress is particularly strong in Japan and Korea, where companies are moving forward with several major demonstrations, and the 
governments have established the first auctions for hydrogen and ammonia-based electricity generation.  
 
Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 21
Overview and outlook 
Global hydrogen demand continued to grow in 2023 to reach a new high of more than 97 Mt, a 2.5% increase compared with 2022 (Figure 2.1). Demand has been 
growing continuously for several decades, with the exception of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic led to an economic slowdown. We estimate that growth will 
continue in 2024 and global hydrogen demand could reach close to 100 Mt. The regional distribution of demand remained largely unchanged from 2022: 
China was again the largest hydrogen user, accounting for nearly one-third of global demand (close to 28 Mt), more than double that of the second largest user, the United States, with 13 Mt (14% of global demand). Hydrogen demand grew modestly in all major regions, apart from in the Middle East, where growth was much steeper (more than 6% growth year-on-year, due to an increase in demand in refining and methanol production) and India (more than 5% growth year-on-year due to larger demand in refining and the steel sector). 
Figure 2.1

Notes: NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. “Other” includes buildings and biofuels upgrading. 2024e = estimate for 2024. The estimated value for 2024 is a projection based on trends observed until June 2024.  
Hydrogen demand reached 97 Mt in 2023 but remained highly concentrated in traditional applications in industry and refining.  
Hydrogen demand remains concentrated in traditional applications (Box 2.1), namely refining, the chemical sector (ammonia and methanol production) and 
steel manufacturing (to produce iron via the direct reduced iron [DRI] route using fossil-based synthesis gas). This demand is almost completely met with hydrogen produced from unabated fossil fuels. As in previous years, the growth in global hydrogen demand was not a result of policy support, but rather of global industry trends, and had no benefit in terms of mitigating climate change.

CO2 emissions associated with hydrogen production and use increased to reach 920 Mt CO2 1.5% more than in 2022 and equivalent to the annual emissions of 
Indonesia and France combined. In the transition to a net zero emissions energy system, demand for hydrogen produced with unabated fossil fuels will need to be replaced with demand for low-emissions hydrogen. Furthermore, use of low-emissions hydrogen will also need to expand to new applications in sectors in which emissions are hard to abate, such as heavy industry, long-distance transport, the production of hydrogen-based fuels or electricity generation and storage. Uptake of hydrogen in these new applications grew nearly 40% in 2023 compared with 2022, although they still account for less than 1% of global demand (and less than 0.1% if excluding biofuels upgrading). In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), hydrogen demand reaches close to 150 Mtpa by 2030, 45% of which is low-emissions hydrogen. Almost 40% of global demand comes from new applications, meaning that demand in these new applications needs to grow more than 80-fold by 2030. 
Box 2.1 
Reporting hydrogen demand in the Global Hydrogen Review 
In this report, demand includes hydrogen that has been intentionally produced for utilisation, including more than 75 Mt H2 which is used as pure hydrogen in ammonia production and refining, and more than 20 Mt H2 which is mixed with carbon-containing gases in methanol production and steel manufacturing. It 
excludes around 30 Mt H2 which is present in residual gases from industrial processes (e.g. coke ovens and steam crackers), which is used for heat and 
electricity generation. This hydrogen is not deliberately produced for a specific application, rather its use is linked to the inherent presence of hydrogen in these residual streams. In addition, in this report we do not include estimations of historical use of small amounts of hydrogen in glassmaking, electronics and metal processing (which account for around 1 Mtpa).  
Traditional and new applications for hydrogen 
Beyond the existing applications for hydrogen in refining, the chemical industry, steel production, and other specialised applications, hydrogen can also be used in a wide range of new applications. 
Hydrogen has not yet been used at scale in these applications, but decarbonisation efforts are expected to drive up hydrogen use in some of these new applications, particularly in sectors where emissions are hard to abate, and other low-emissions technologies are either unavailable or very difficult to implement.

Considering 0 kg CO2/kg H2 for hydrogen produced as a by-product in naphtha crackers and steam crackers. Considering a maximum of 10 kg CO2/kg H2 emissions would increase up to 1 070 Mt CO2. This includes direct emissions from hydrogen production and close to 300 Mt of CO2 utilised in the synthesis of urea and methanol, the majority of which is later emitted. This excludes upstream and midstream emissions for fossil fuel supply.

Tracking total hydrogen use alone is not sufficient to assess progress on hydrogen adoption, and particularly whether it is happening in the direction and at the pace required for hydrogen to play its role in the clean energy transition. The use of hydrogen by application also needs to be tracked in order to assess uptake in new applications. For reporting purposes in the IEA’s Global Hydrogen Review, we use two categories of applications for hydrogen: 
 Traditional applications, including refining; feedstock to produce ammonia, methanol and other chemicals; and as a reducing agent to produce DRI using 
fossil-based synthesis gas. This category also includes the use of hydrogen in electronics, glassmaking or metal processing, although these are not included 
in our tracking. 
 Potential new applications, such as the use of hydrogen as a reducing agent in 100%-hydrogen DRI, long-distance transport, production of hydrogen-based 
fuels (such as ammonia or synthetic hydrocarbons), biofuels upgrading (e.g. hydrogenation of fats and oils), high-temperature heating in industry, and 
electricity storage and generation, as well as other applications in which hydrogen use is expected to be very small due to the existence of more efficient 
low-emissions alternatives. 
Demand creation for low-emissions hydrogen  
Demand for low-emissions hydrogen grew almost 10% in 2023 compared to 2022 but remains very low – accounting for less than 1% of global demand. Low-
emissions hydrogen is more costly than hydrogen from unabated fossil fuels, which is preventing its adoption among most existing hydrogen users. This 
premium is also hindering its uptake in new applications in which low-emissions hydrogen could replace the direct use of fossil fuels. Without policy action that can help close the cost gap or stimulate market players to commit to using low-emissions hydrogen, demand will remain limited to small efforts from companies that have ambitious sustainability goals, or want to familiarise themselves with the technology through demonstration efforts before a larger market emerges. Against this backdrop, demand-side policies are now starting to attract more attention (see Chapter 6. Policies), following several years in which governments have prioritised the supply side. With the current policy landscape, demand for low-emissions hydrogen could grow ten-fold by 2030, reaching more than 6 Mtpa. 
While this would represent significant progress compared with today, it is a far cry from the 65 Mtpa needed by 2030 in the NZE Scenario.

Notes: NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. “Other” includes buildings and biofuels upgrading. 
Demand for low-emissions hydrogen could exceed 6 Mtpa by 2030 with current policy settings, but would need to reach 65 Mtpa, across many applications, to align with the NZE Scenario. 
In the private sector, the number and size of offtake agreements between companies have grown in recent years. These offtake agreements are crucial for 
helping to derisk investment in projects to produce low-emissions hydrogen. In 2023, companies signed agreements for more than 2 Mt of low-emissions 
hydrogen-equivalent per year (Mtpa H2-eq), of which nearly 40% is covered by firm agreements. The largest share of agreements (35%) was related to hydrogen trade projects without a disclosed final application, although all these agreements are still at the preliminary stage. The second largest share was linked to the chemical sector, accounting for almost one-fifth of the total offtake agreed, and almost half of the agreements are firm. The chemical sector is today the sector with the largest historical offtake included in firm agreements: of the 1.7 Mtpa H2-eq that have been included in firm offtake agreements across all sectors since 2021, nearly 0.6 Mtpa H2-eq belong to the chemical sector. Notably, the NEOM project – the largest electrolysis project in the world currently under construction – can count on an offtake contract for its full production with Air Products. Other large projects in Canada and India that have very recently reached FID also have offtake agreements with the chemicals sector.  

This analysis excludes numerous small offtake agreements in the road transport sector, which altogether account for very small quantities at global level. As a reference, global demand for hydrogen in the transport sector in 2023 reached around 60 kt (see Transport), mostly produced from unabated fossil fuels.
This includes agreements for offtake of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. 
Firm agreements include contractual arrangements with binding conditions for both suppliers and offtakers, whereas preliminary agreements include other type of non-binding deals, such as MoUs. 

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 25  
The refining and shipping sectors, despite having agreed smaller quantities than the chemical sector, both have larger shares of firm agreements. This suggests that traditional applications for hydrogen (ammonia production, methanol production and refining) are the best-placed to adopt low-emissions hydrogen in the near term, since they present a lower technology risk than new applications.  
Other sectors where there have been a significant number of offtake agreements are steel, electricity generation and aviation, with shares of firm agreements ranging from 20-30%. However, offtake agreements in these sectors are much more regionally concentrated. Most of the offtake agreements in power generation have offtakers concentrated in Japan and Korea, boosted by government plans to use hydrogen and ammonia to decarbonise power generation, although the suppliers are distributed across Australia, the Middle East, North America and Southeast Asia. In the case of steel, almost all offtake agreements (both on the supply and offtake sides) are between European companies, which have for many years spearheaded technology developments in the sector. Finally, in the case of aviation, offtakers are mostly from European companies, a trend that seems to have accelerated in response to the ReFuelEU Aviation mandates that entered into force in 2023, although suppliers include project developers in Europe and in North America.

The recent trend for calls for tenders is also a sign of action in the private sector: in the past year, six companies have launched calls for tenders that together account for close to 1 Mtpa H2 (Table 2.1). The largest tender was launched by TotalEnergies in September 2023, with the aim of decarbonising hydrogen used in its refining operations in Europe. The company recently reported that a large number of offers were received, though at a high average price of around EUR 8/kg H2 (USD ~9/kg H2).

In addition to these initiatives, the private sector is also developing sectoral coalitions in which several companies join forces to aggregate demand for 
hydrogen-based fuels, thus distributing cost and risks among the members of coalition while sending larger demand signals that can facilitate scale-up on the supply side. In the aviation sector, efforts include the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance and the Qantas Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (see Aviation for more details). In the maritime sector, the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA, launched by the Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels platform in 2023) announced in April 2024 the successful completion of its first collective tender for zero-emissions shipping solutions. Although the winner of the first.

Two of the tenders were launched by state-owned companies: the Solar Energy Corporation of India and National Highways.

tender will use biomethane as shipping fuel, ZEMBA announced that subsequent tenders (the next is expected before the end of 2024) will focus on developing the market for hydrogen-based fuels. Also in shipping, in 2024 the Rocky Mountain Institute, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, the 
ZEMBA and Hapag-Lloyd are expected to launch a new pilot system for Maritime Book-and-Claim chain of custody. In the steel sector, in September 2023 RMI also launched a Sustainable Steel Buyers Platform to aggregate demand for low-emissions steel. 
Box 2.2 
Co-ordinated efforts to facilitate market development The uncertainty surrounding demand for low-emissions hydrogen is a significant barrier to investment on the supply side. Similarly, offtakers face uncertainties about supplies being available when they plan to adopt low-emissions hydrogen. 
Furthermore, infrastructure developers require clear insights into potential flows of low-emissions hydrogen between producers and users in order to create viable deployment plans. 
Co-ordination among stakeholders can mitigate these uncertainties by de-risking offtake for suppliers, improving visibility of supply for users, and facilitating planning for infrastructure developers. Such co-ordination can, in turn, stimulate investment flows and accelerate the adoption of low-emissions hydrogen. To improve co-ordination, several stakeholders have launched match-making platforms that aim to facilitate market development in its early stages, connect producers with potential offtakers, assist infrastructure developers in planning, and enhance market transparency. Some platform developers also aim to facilitate price discovery. 
The European Commission pioneered this effort in 2021 with the Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) Hydrogen Match-making 
Procedure, with the aim of connecting stakeholders for the preparation of proposals for the IPCEI Hydrogen application, although this platform only operated 
for a short period of time until the proposals for IPCEI were presented in 2022. The first platform to have operated continuously was the H2 Matchmaker tool of the US Department of Energy (DoE), launched in 2022. This tool helps “clean” hydrogen producers, end users and other stakeholders across the hydrogen value chain – including infrastructure developers; manufacturers; Engineering, Procurement and Construction companies; and researchers – find potential partners to build networks and develop comprehensive supply chain projects for low-emissions hydrogen production and use. The platform is now integrated with the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program, enabling stakeholders to share detailed information about their activities, forecasts and project descriptions.

In the European Union, under the decarbonised gases and hydrogen package approved in April 2024, the European Commission has created a pilot mechanism 
to collect, process and provide access to information on the demand and supply of low-emissions hydrogen and its derivatives. This allows European offtakers to match with both European and non-European suppliers. It is expected to be operational from mid-2025, and to run for 5 years as part of the European 
Hydrogen Bank. Some European Gas Transmission System Operators have also launched their own platforms. For example, Gasunie introduced its Match & Connect service in May 2023, which helps market parties connect with potential customers, producers, or shippers of hydrogen via an online platform. Fluxys launched a request for information to collect data on potential hydrogen producers and demand in Belgium, informing its infrastructure planning. Unlike Gasunie, which does not play an active role in matching market parties, Fluxys is currently facilitating regional mutual exchanges among companies that participated in the request for information process, specifically in Antwerp, Ghent, Hainaut, Liège and Limbourg. 
At the international level, the Clean Hydrogen Mission has also launched a match-making tool as part of its Hydrogen Valleys platform, to help stakeholders to connect with the hydrogen valleys featured. Also noteworthy are the activities of Hintco, a subsidiary of the H2Global Foundation. While Hintco is not a match-making platform, it aims to improve market transparency by publishing information from the results of the H2Global mechanism auctions. This includes details on the companies that will be selling the hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels, prices, and locations for production and delivery, as well as information on the companies that will buy the products, and at what price. 
Refining 
Hydrogen demand in refining reached 43 Mt in 2023, over 1 Mt more than the previous record from 2022. Growth in demand has been concentrated in China 
(+0.9 Mt) and the Middle East (+0.5 Mt), whereas demand in all the other major regions remained largely similar to 2022. Demand growth in China was a 
consequence of the turnaround in government policy with regards to restricting exports, and the lifting of pandemic-related measures, which led to record demand and record high refinery runs at the start of the year. However, the United States still accounts for the largest share of demand and is still expected to process more crude than China through 2024, before being overtaken.

Hydrogen use by region and source of hydrogen for refining, historical and in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, 2019-2030 
Notes: NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Fossil w/o CCUS = fossil fuels without carbon capture, utilisation and storage; Fossil w CCUS = fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage. “Onsite” refers to the production of hydrogen inside refineries, including dedicated captive production and as a by-product of catalytic reformers. 
Hydrogen demand in refining reached another record high in 2023, but this trend is expected to reverse soon thanks to measures that could affect demand for oil products.  
As in previous years, hydrogen demand in refineries was mostly met by onsite production from unabated fossil fuels (45%) and by-production from different 
operations (more than 35%), such as naphtha catalytic reforming. The remainder (close to 20%) was externally sourced as merchant hydrogen,6* and mostly 
produced from unabated fossil fuels. 
Although demand growth for refined oil products (and therefore for hydrogen in refining) is expected to slow down in the near future, it is not expected to fall enough to get on track with the NZE Scenario, in which global demand for hydrogen in refining drops to under 35 Mt by 2030.  
At the same time, the adoption of low-emissions hydrogen in refining is expected to accelerate. In 2023, demand for low-emissions hydrogen in refining reached almost 250 kt, just 4% more than in 2022. Practically all this growth came from the ramp-up of the Yanchang Integrated Carbon Capture and Storage Demonstration project (which entered into operation in mid-2022) and Sinopec’s Kuqa facility (which started partial operation in 2023), both in China. The Kuqa project is today the largest operational electrolysis plant (260 MW), but it has been experiencing operational challenges related to lower-than-expected efficiencies of the electrolysers supplied, and issues with their ability to handle power fluctuations 6* Merchant hydrogen refers to hydrogen that is purchased from external producers who then deliver hydrogen to the end users, normally by trucking or using regional, privately owned hydrogen networks. In the case of refineries, merchant hydrogen is typically produced in plants very close to the refinery, and sometimes even in the same location, but in plants operated by another company, given that hydrogen is not a global commodity today.

from the renewable electricity generation assets. This has limited its production, and it is not expected to operate at full capacity until 2025. Elsewhere, since the start of 2024, one 10 MW electrolysis (able to produce around 1.5 ktpa H2) project has started operation, in Hungary, and some others currently under construction are expected to become operational before the end of the year. However, these additions are not expected to have a significant impact on the use of low-emissions hydrogen in refineries this year, with demand potentially reaching 260 kt. At the time of writing, projects for low-emissions hydrogen for refineries accounting for a total production of more than 220 ktpa have already reached FID or are currently 
under construction. Since the Global Hydrogen Review 2023 (GHR 2023), a handful of large projects for the production of low-emissions hydrogen for 
refineries have reached FID: 
 
Two 100 MW electrolysis projects, one from GALP at the Sines refinery (Portugal) and another from Shell at its refinery in Rheinland (Germany), each able to 
produce up to 15 ktpa of renewable hydrogen. 
 
The first phase of BP’s HyVal project at Castellon (Spain), with a capacity of 25 MW (able to produce close to 4 ktpa H2). This could be extended up to 2 GW 
in the future. 
 
Two projects, one from Air Liquide and one from Air Products, for the production of around 100 kt of hydrogen from natural gas with CCUS (both retrofitting existing hydrogen production units) linked to the Porthos carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in Rotterdam.  
 
Shell’s Polaris project, with an undisclosed hydrogen production capacity, which will capture 650 kt of CO2 from the Scotford refinery and chemicals complex 
(Canada). 
If all the announced projects for the production of low-emissions hydrogen for use in refineries are realised on time (according to their original development plans), 1.6 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen could be used in refining activities by 2030 (close to 1.5 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of development are excluded). 
This would meet around one-quarter of the need in the NZE Scenario. Europe dominates the pipeline of announced projects, followed by North America. The 
majority of projects have not yet reached FID, but the adoption of targets for the use of renewable hydrogen in the EU Renewable Energy Directive (which are now in the process of being transposed to national legislation), is expected to bring about more FIDs in the region in the near future. For example, the Dutch government is working on a scheme to award tradable certificates to fuel suppliers that adopt hydrogen that complies with the renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) regulation in refineries from 2026. Elsewhere, India has also taken first steps towards adopting low-emissions hydrogen in refining, with state-owned oil companies having opened tenders to build, own and operate low-emissions hydrogen production in plants in the Panipat and Numaligarh refineries

Only planned projects with a disclosed start year of operation are included. FID includes projects that are operational, under construction or that have reached FID. GHR 2023 shows the estimated production of low-emissions hydrogen from projects that were included in the IEA Hydrogen Production Projects Database as of August 2023. 
Source: IEA Hydrogen Production Projects Database (October 2024). 
Based on announced projects, 1.6 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen could be produced in refineries by 2030, an amount that is little changed from last year. 
In addition to traditional oil refineries, biorefineries are attracting growing interest due to the decarbonisation potential of biofuels. Some projects under development are already considering the use of low-emissions hydrogen for upgrading these biofuels. Two plants, one in Canada (using renewable hydrogen) and one in France (using hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCUS), are expected to start operating in 2025-2026. In addition, in May 2024, OMV Petrom took an FID on a facility for the production of hydrotreated vegetable oils in its Petrobrazi refinery (Romania), which includes a 55 MW electrolysis plant to be operational from 2028. 
If all announced projects are realised according to their original development plants, close to 500 ktpa of low-emissions hydrogen could be used in the 
production of biofuels by 2030. 
Finally, hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels can also play a role in reducing emissions from high-temperature processes in refineries. Essar has completed 
the installation of a first-of-a-kind furnace able to operate with pure hydrogen in its Stanlow refinery (United Kingdom), although it will operate with natural gas until low-emissions hydrogen from the HyNet project can be supplied (expected in 
2027).

In addition, in March 2024, Idemitsu demonstrated for the first time the use of ammonia as a combustion fuel in a commercial naphtha cracking furnace at its 
Tokuyama complex (Japan), displacing 20% of fossil fuel consumption in the furnace.  
Industry 
Global hydrogen demand in industry reached 54 Mt in 2023, an increase of almost 2% year-on-year. About 60% of this demand was for ammonia production, 30% 
for methanol and 10% for DRI in the iron and steel subsector – the same sectoral distribution as in previous years (Figure 2.6). The majority of hydrogen used in industry is produced from unabated fossil fuels in the same facilities where it is later used. Carbon capture is a common practice in some industry subsectors, although most of the 140 Mtpa of CO2 captured is used for other industrial applications (such as urea production) and ends up being released, with only a handful of projects storing CO2 underground. As a result, hydrogen production in industry was responsible for around 680 Mt of direct CO2 emissions in 2023, up 0.6% from 2022, approximately equal to the total CO2 emissions of Türkiye.

Hydrogen use in industry increased in 2023 to reach 54 Mt, mostly in ammonia, methanol and steel production. 
 
Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 33  
The increase in global hydrogen demand in industry was mainly driven by use in ammonia production, with global demand rising by 2.2%, and by DRI, with 4.8% 
growth. China remains the main consumer of hydrogen in industrial applications, accounting for 34% of global industrial use, followed by the Middle East (15%), North America (10%), India (9%) and Europe (6%).  
The Middle East is currently seeing some of the fastest growth in demand in industry, with a 4% increase in 2023. This is mainly driven by methanol production (up 8% in 2023), especially in Iran (+20%), which is investing in methanol production to satisfy the needs of the chemical industry and the transportation sector. Two projects are due to start production by the end of 2024, Dena Petrochemical and Siraf Energy, each adding 1.6 Mt of capacity. On the basis of projects that are relatively committed and those already in construction, Iran could add a further 5 Mt of fossil-based methanol production capacity in the next 5 years – accounting for a large share of global production, which currently stands at around 115 Mt.  
In Europe, the 10% growth in hydrogen demand in industry in 2023 must be seen in the context of a 30% fall in demand in 2022, when ammonia production dropped by one-third as a result of the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ammonia production picked up in 2023 as energy prices stabilised, growing by 10%, but remains far below pre-invasion levels. As a result, Europe’s hydrogen demand in industry in 2023 was 25% lower than in 2021.  
In the NZE Scenario, hydrogen use in industry grows to 70 Mtpa by 2030. Meeting this need would require close to a 4% annual increase in production, compared to just 1.3% over the past 4 years. Furthermore, about one-quarter of industrial hydrogen demand needs to be satisfied by low-emissions hydrogen by 2030, which would require most new capacity additions to be low-emissions, as well as retrofits to some existing stock. Beyond traditional applications in the chemical and steel sectors, hydrogen use also increases in new industrial applications. For example, by 2030 in the NZE Scenario, hydrogen DRI and high-temperature heating together account for around 15% of global hydrogen demand in industry.  
Low-emissions hydrogen production in industrial plants in 2023 was about 280 kt, almost the same level as in 2022. More than 90% of this capacity relies on fossil fuels with CCUS, with installations spread across North America, the Middle East and China. In 2024, production is expected to grow to 370 kt on the basis of planned capacity additions. There has been relatively significant progress in the production of hydrogen from electrolysis since the publication of the GHR 2023, with over 1 GW of electrolyser capacity likely to commence production in 2024. As much as two-thirds of this capacity is in China, and of this, more than 90% is for the production of ammonia. Outside of China, Yara’s Porsgrunn plant (Norway), CF’s Donaldsonville plant (United States) and the Unigel project (Brazil) are the largest projects producing low-emissions hydrogen coming online in 2024.

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 34  
The near-term outlook for low-emissions hydrogen production in industry continues to improve: Together, projects already under construction or which have 
taken an FID would be able to produce more than 750 ktpa by 2030. The vast majority are concentrated in China and Europe (with around 45% and 30% 
respectively). In addition, there has been an increase in projects for methanol production, particularly in China, though it is likely that this is for use as an alternative fuel (for example in shipping) rather than for industrial use. 
Nevertheless, despite this improving outlook, some projects planning to produce DRI using low-emissions hydrogen are reporting that availability of hydrogen is limited, and that support to improve affordability is insufficient, which might delay their planned switch to using 100% hydrogen. 
The most noteworthy developments since the release of the GHR 2023 are:  
 AM Green took FID for a 1.3 GW electrolysis project (India) able to produce around 1 Mtpa of ammonia for manufacturing nitrogen fertilisers. This project has been certified by CertifHy to be compliant with the EU regulation for RFNBOs. 
 Shanghai Electric - Taonan Wind Power with Biomass for Green Methanol (China) started construction of its plant to produce 250 kt of methanol per year 
using electrolytic hydrogen.  
 The Hy4Chem-EI project (Germany) is beginning construction of a 54 MW electrolysis project, with an estimated production capacity of around 8 ktpa H2 for 
the chemicals industry. 
 Yara’s green fertiliser project at Porsgrunn, Herøya (Norway) began operations in May 2024, using a 24 MW electrolyser to produce hydrogen for use in ammonia production. 
 Project Oshivela (Namibia) began construction in late 2023 and is expected to come online from Q4 2024. The project initially aims to produce 15 kt of DRI per year using hydrogen from a 12 MW electrolyser (with an estimated production capacity of up to 2 ktpa H2), with future scale-up to 1 Mtpa of DRI capacity. This is one of the first African projects aiming to use low-emissions hydrogen to have moved beyond feasibility studies. 
 The Hygenco JSL plant opened in early 2024 and is India’s first steel plant using hydrogen from electrolysis and renewable electricity for the annealing process. Many additional projects have been announced in the past year. If all projects come to fruition, low-emissions hydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS could reach 1.5 Mtpa by 2030, and production from electrolysis could reach 4.8 Mtpa by 2030 (2.6 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of development are excluded) (Figure 2.7).

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 35  
This is a noteworthy increase, but this growth is occurring from a very low base, and the combined 6.2 Mt of low-emissions hydrogen represents only 60% of what is required under the NZE Scenario. Some of the newly announced projects include:  
 FertigHy’s first plant (France), which aims to produce 500 ktpa of nitrogen-based fertilisers from electrolytic hydrogen. 
 The Cormorant Clean Energy Project (United States), which will capture 1.4 Mtpa CO2 from ammonia production. 
 Waaree Odisha (India), which plans to produce 1.2 Mtpa of ammonia based on renewable hydrogen. 
 Zijin Mining Renewable energy project (Serbia), which aims to produce 30 ktpa of hydrogen for use at a copper mine and smelter.

Announced projects for the onsite production of low-emissions hydrogen in industry can reach 6.2 Mtpa by 2030, meeting 60% of needs in the NZE Scenario.  
Nonetheless, to align with the NZE Scenario, the onsite production of low-emissions hydrogen from electrolysis using renewable electricity, and from fossil 
fuels with CCUS in the industry sector, needs to reach 7.4 Mtpa and 2.7 Mtpa of hydrogen, respectively, nearly double the production potential of the current project pipeline (and almost tripling it if projects at very early stages of development are excluded). 

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand

In addition to hydrogen produced onsite in industrial facilities, a significant number of projects aim to produce merchant hydrogen for delivery to industrial consumers. 
Merchant hydrogen projects can have certain advantages, such as producers partnering with multiple industrial clients to spread risk, but transport infrastructure is required. We estimate that these projects could supply an additional 0.8 Mtpa of hydrogen to industrial consumers by 2030 (0.7 Mt if projects at very early stages of development are excluded). Some key merchant hydrogen projects that have been announced are the Baytown project (United States), Sinopec’s Ordos development (China), Project Catalina (Spain), the HyDeal project (Spain) and the Actis-Fortescue project (Oman). However, the realisation of these projects depends on their ability to secure offtakers for all their potential production (which in turn depends on their ability to reduce current production costs), and on the prospects for new or reused infrastructure to transport hydrogen to end users. 
These challenges have already led some of these projects to revise their originally announced plans.  
Use of hydrogen for heating applications in industry Putting the world on a pathway consistent with net zero emissions by 2050 will require new technologies that are still at the R&D phase today, such as for the use of hydrogen for high-temperature heating in industry, which is currently being investigated across new use cases in R&D projects. Notably, several projects have recently been started (Table 2.2) with the aim of demonstrating the use of hydrogen in specialised process heating equipment and extending existing experience to industries outside of the chemical and steel sectors that are not used to working with hydrogen.

Selected applications of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels in industry and associated research and demonstration projects 

Application 
Research and demonstration projects 

Hydrogen in industrial Boilers 
While hydrogen has been used in industrial boilers for many years, this has generally been in specialised industries with significant experience using 
and handling hydrogen, like the chlor-alkali industry. Projects are ongoing in the food and drink industry, such as WhiskHy in Scotland, and in the paper 
industry, such as KCA in Australia. 

Ammonia in industrial boilers 
Ammonia, a key hydrogen derivative and hydrogen carrier, could provide heat to low-temperature heating in industrial boilers in place of natural gas. 
The UK-based “Amburn” project aims to demonstrate a megawatt scale ammonia-fed steam boiler system at a customer site.
  
Application 
Research and demonstration projects 

Hydrogen in alumina calcination 
Natural gas could be replaced with hydrogen as a fuel for the high-temperature calcination process in alumina refining. In 2023 an AUD 111.1 million (Australian dollars) demonstration project was funded by Australian Renewable Energy Agency, using a 2.5 MW onsite electrolyser and retrofitting one of the calciners in a refinery to use a hydrogen burner. 

Hydrogen in glass furnaces 
Hydrogen could be used in glass furnaces, potentially in combination with electricity and other fuel sources. In Germany, Saint-Gobain is using hydrogen to replace more than 30% of the fossil fuels used in flat glass production. Ardagh Group is also replacing 20% of the natural gas with hydrogen for the production of some glass bottles, and Schott has recently produced optical glass using 100% hydrogen.  

Blended firing of hydrogen in direct fired equipment
Hydrogen is already used in some cases as an additive to enhance combustion properties, and could be used as part of a low-emissions fuel mix in many sectors. For example, trials in the United Kingdom have investigated hydrogen as a partial replacement for fossil fuels in cement kilns and asphalt production. 

100% firing of hydrogen in direct fired equipment 
Hydrogen is also being tested as a “full” replacement fuel in some pieces of equipment, in some cases using oxyfuel combustion technology. In 2023, 
Tokyo Gas and building materials manufacturer Lixil tested hydrogen instead of natural gas for the heat treatment of aluminium products. Findings 
suggested there was no effect on the quality of aluminium products. In Europe, the HyTecHeat, HyINHeat and H2Glass projects that started in 
2023 are looking to develop hydrogen-fired high-temperature furnaces, and in the United States an aluminium casting and rolling facility is planning to 
test hydrogen firing. 

Transport 
Road transport 
The use of hydrogen as a means of decarbonising road transport continues to expand, increasing more quickly in 2023 (by around 55%) than in 2022 (around 
40%) due, in particular, to growth in heavy fuel cell trucks and buses in China. In spite of this, hydrogen demand in road transport reached just 60 kt in 2023 (less than 0.1% of global demand). 
  
For decarbonisation, the hydrogen used must be low-emissions, although today hydrogen demand in transport is met with a variety of sources, including unabated fossil fuels.  
The estimate of year-on-year hydrogen demand growth shown in the GHR 2023 (45%) has been revised due to adjustments to historic values for average fuel efficiency and mileage.

Hydrogen consumption in road transport by vehicle segment and region, 2021-2023 
Notes: RoW = Rest of World; US = United States. Commercial vehicles include light commercial vehicles and medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Assumptions on annual mileage and fuel economy come from the IEA Global Energy and Climate Model.  
Hydrogen use in road transport increased by around 55% in 2023, with heavy-duty vehicles accounting for almost 85% of this growth.  
In China, fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) deployment has focused on heavy-duty vehicles, which have relatively high mileages, meaning that in 2023, consumption of hydrogen for road transport grew almost twice as fast as in the United States, and over three times as fast as in Europe. In Korea and Japan, the light-duty vehicle segment continues to be a focus for FCEVs, although growth in this segment is slowing down, and hydrogen use in road transport in these countries reached only around 7 kt combined in 2023.  
Growth in fuel cell passenger car stock slowed significantly in the past year, falling from more than 35% in 2022 to just under 15% in 2023, with slow sales continuing into the first half of 2024. In contrast, healthier sales in fuel cell buses and trucks increased the stock by 25% and more than 50%, respectively, between 2022 and 2023. The total stock of FCEVs across all road modes, as of the end of June 2024, stands at around 93 000. 

For comparison, there were over 40 million battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (excluding two- and three-wheelers) at the end of 2023, as described in the Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2024.

Partnership; Korea, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport; International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy; and Clean Energy Ministerial Hydrogen Initiative country surveys. 
Growth in FCEVs was strongest in the truck segment for the second year in a row. 
Cars and vans
Korea, the United States and Japan continue to lead deployment of fuel cell cars, with over 50%, more than 25%, and over 10%, respectively, of the global stock. However, sales have slowed across all regions, and global stock increased by just 15% between 2022 and 2023 and by less than 5% from the end of 2023 to June 2024.  
Despite this slowdown, Honda have released a fuel cell version of their best-selling CR-V in California, competing with the Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo. In China, sales of passenger cars are increasing, with sales of the Maxus Euniq 7 and Hongqi H5 reaching over 500 and 150 units, respectively, though China remains unusual in that the car segment makes up the smallest share of the hydrogen fleet. 
BMW has been piloting their fuel cell car prototype in Japan, the United States and Europe, and is planning to begin mass producing fuel cell cars in 2028.  
The taxi business continues to be an interesting use case, given the advantages of faster refuelling and longer ranges compared to battery electric vehicles, with the French FCEV taxi operator Hype expanding into Brussels. These advantages are also seen as having strong potential for decarbonising the delivery business.  Interest from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the van segment was also seen with Stellantis reaffirming their commitment to produce fuel cell vans in Europe, while Sweden is now offering subsidies for fuel cell vans.

Fuel cell electric vehicles in the United States are concentrated in the state of California.  
For comparison, the stock of electric cars and vans increased by around 50% from 2022 to 2023.  

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 40  
The number of 
fuel cell vans on Chinese roads is over four times that of cars, and accounts for over 90% of the global total, further demonstrating the focus on commercial vehicles. Nevertheless, fuel cell vans made up less than 0.5% of the combined sales and just 0.2% of the combined stock of plug-in hybrid, battery electric, and fuel cell vans globally in 2023. 
Trucks 
Trucks are the fastest-growing sector for fuel cell vehicles, with the stock increasing by over 50% in 2023, more than twice as fast as buses, and three times faster than cars. As of June 2024, the global stock stands at more than 12 000, but – as in 2022 – around 95% of these are in China. Nevertheless, this should not hide the substantial growth seen in both the United States and Europe, albeit from a lower base. By the end of 2022 there were around 135 fuel cell trucks in Europe, but that had increased to around 350 as of June 2024. In the United States, over the same period, fuel cell trucks increased from just 10 to around 170. The share of trucks in the global FCEV fleet has therefore risen from less than 9% in 2021 to almost 13% as of June 2024. 
Commercial trials to prove the technology and gather data on performance in different use cases are being undertaken around the world, including in the 
United Kingdom, New Zealand and Saudi Arabia. There have also been new commitments to the technology in the United States, for example through orders 
for Nikola’s fuel cell truck, which officially entered the market last year, with 35 units delivered in 2023. An order has been placed for a further 100 trucks in 2025, contributing to the growing hydrogen hub at the Port of Los Angeles, as well as another 50 trucks ordered by a haulier that deemed battery electric trucks insufficient for their needs after an almost 2-year-long trial. Despite this positive news, Nikola still faces considerable headwinds, having incurred losses of almost USD 1 billion in 2023. Another fuel cell truck maker from the United States, Hyzon, have halted their operations in Europe and Australia, in part due to having accumulated losses of over USD 275 million. This decision can, at least in part, be attributed to lower-than-expected demand following the cancellation of purchase announcements, such as by Glasgow City Council (United Kingdom).

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 41
Innovations to fuel cell trucking are still being made, such as through a hydrogen-electric hybrid system in which the fuel cell acts as a range extender, thereby making the powertrain technology suitable for a larger share of duty cycles. Elsewhere, Daimler and Linde have jointly developed a novel liquefied hydrogen refuelling process aimed at providing ranges of more than 1 000 km which is now being deployed in Germany. The two companies also aim to support the establishment of a common refuelling standard for liquid refuelling, to enable commercial use of the technology. The use of hydrogen combustion engines in trucks may also support emissions reductions compared to conventional diesel trucks. MAN is due to launch such trucks in 2025, and Volvo Trucks will begin testing in 2026. This technology may have a particular role to play in the medium term, while fuel cells continue to face challenges such as high costs, lower durability in difficult operating conditions and uncertainty around the availability of skilled technicians and spare parts. 
Model availability is an important factor in increasing deployment of fuel cell trucks, particularly in the short to medium term, so as to offer customers choice and options suited to their needs, and model options are expanding around the world (Figure 2.10). However, given that China has the highest sales of trucks, but a smaller number of models available than North America, it is also clear that policy – and not just model availability – is influencing uptake. Europe has fewer models available than North America or China, though new additions are being announced, such as by Symbio (expected in late 2024). Partnerships between Honda and Isuzu, and Quantron and Ford, are also expected to add to model availability in the coming years. Retrofitting of existing trucks, where the diesel engine is replaced with an electric fuel cell powertrain, can also increase vehicle availability. H2X Global, who specialise in retrofitting, have announced the development of both a smaller 3.5 t truck as well as trucks in the range of 16 t to 44 t in 2024.  

The average range of fuel cell heavy-duty trucks in the Global Drive to Zero ZETI tool database is around 600 km.  
Internal combustion engines are more tolerant of environmental contaminants such as dust, can operate with lower fuel purity, and withstand operational vibration better than the fuel cell powertrains currently available.

Figure 2.10 Fuel cell electric vehicle models by original equipment manufacturer headquarters, type of vehicle, and release date, 2022-2024 
Notes: MD = medium-duty; HD = heavy-duty. This figure is based on a continuously updated inventory and may not be fully comprehensive due to new model announcements and small manufacturers not yet captured in the database. Values for 2022 include models released between 2016 and 2022 inclusive. The database contains coaches, school buses, shuttle buses, and transit buses, categorised here as “Bus”, which refers to those with more than 25 seats. “MD truck” includes medium-duty (MD) trucks, MD step vans, and cargo vans with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of greater than 3.5 t but less than 15 t. “HD truck” includes all freight trucks with a GVW of greater than 15 t. “Specialised truck” includes garbage trucks, concrete mixers, and other specialised mobile commercial trucks. Buses with 25 seats or fewer and light commercial vehicles, which have a GVW of less than 3.5 t, are excluded from this analysis. Vehicles of the same model that appear more than once in the database, but with small variations in specifications, such as power, payload or seating, are counted as one model. 
Source: IEA analysis based on the Global Drive to Zero ZETI tool database. 
North American producers offer the widest range of trucks, while Chinese manufacturers lead in the bus sector, with Europe lagging behind in terms of heavy-duty fuel cell vehicle offering. 
Buses 
Fuel cell bus stock increased by almost 25% in 2023 compared to 2022. China again accounted for the majority of new additions, deploying over 75% of the more than 1 500 fuel cell buses added in 2023, thereby constituting a similar share of the global stock of more than 9 100 fuel cell buses as of June 2024. In terms of year-on-year stock growth, Europe and Japan have similar rates to China, between 20% and 25%, while Korea experienced an annual growth rate of 130%. 
Similarly to trucks, fuel cell buses continue to be trialled, often alongside battery electric models. Many European cities have taken delivery of or placed orders for fuel cell buses, such as Barcelona (Spain), Bologna (Italy), Cottbus and Oberberg (Germany), Paris (France) and Wałbrzych (Poland). Several German cities that already have fuel cell buses in operation, such as Frankfurt and Cologne, among 
others, have opted to expand their fleets. 

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 43  
In Duisburg (Germany), a previous 
decision to use battery electric was reversed in favour of fuel cell buses, with cost being cited as a deciding factor. The city of Cheonan, Korea, will deploy 350 fuel cell buses and the necessary refuelling infrastructure by 2027, through a partnership with SK E&S, expanding on the Incheon fleet announced last year. 
Both will be supplied by SK E&S's plant which liquefies by-product hydrogen for use in transport. However, there have also been several high-profile incidences of cities ending trials or retiring existing fleets, citing issues of reliability and cost. 
Examples include Montpellier and Pau in France, Carinthia in Austria, and Wiesbaden in Germany.  
Key to the increasing sales of fuel cell buses is sufficient availability. In Europe, companies such as Solaris and Wrightbus are expanding production. In Korea, Hyundai has expanded its capacity from 500 to 3 000 units per year in order to keep pace with deployment. In North America, NFI Group are signing fuel cell supply agreements to capitalise on emerging demand. However, by far the largest range of models (and variations thereof) are being produced by a relatively small number of Chinese OEMs, in order to supply both their large domestic market and growing overseas markets, such as Australia. Hydrogen retrofits also have a role o play, as demonstrated by Green Corp, who are installing their technology in 50 coaches in France, in a segment often deemed difficult to electrify. Finally, the continued introduction of hydrogen range extenders for buses can enable the decarbonisation of routes currently deemed unsuitable for battery electric buses, and demonstrates the potential to combine the two technologies.  
Hydrogen refuelling stations There are now close to 1 200 hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS)16 in operation globally, but the overall total grew only marginally in the past year, as the number of new HRS being opened was partially offset by station closures around the world (see Box 2.3), and older HRS were upgraded or replaced (Figure 2.11). As in 2022, China had the largest number of stations in 2023, at over 400, followed by Europe, with 280, Korea at 180, and Japan with over 170. This pattern is reflected by stock growth from 2022 to date, with China adding more than 100 new stations, followed by Europe with over 45 additions and almost 60 in Korea. Over the past few years the stock of operating HRS in Japan has remained relatively constant and the country is now providing subsidies for the maintenance of ageing HRS, to continue to meet customer expectations. Korea has provided large subsidies to existing station owners to deal with the increasing cost of hydrogen in the country. 16* As of June 2024. This includes only HRS for road mobility applications and excludes refuelling points for non-road applications, such as forklifts. There is higher level of uncertainty around HRS stock and additions in 2024 than in previous years due to the number of closures and differences in when various sources publish their figures.  

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 44  
In the United States, there were around 90 HRS in June 2024, but stock fell as low as 55 in 2023, with many stations being closed or temporarily out of service, although some new stations were added. 
In the majority of the regions examined (see Figure 2.11) the ratio of FCEVs to HRS has remained steady in recent years. During periods of relatively high vehicle sales Korea has maintained a ratio of less than around 200 vehicles per HRS, in particular thanks to building around 50 HRS in 2022. The United States is a notable exception, where a number of station closures in California (where FCEV stock is concentrated) led to significant issues for customers in 2023, though many of these stations have since reopened or been replaced, as explored in Box 2.3.

Despite a number of station closures around the world, global stock of HRS increased in 2023, driven by growth in China and Europe. 
Like Japan and Korea, Germany has also been investing in existing stations, including upgrading them to accommodate heavy-duty vehicles (HDV). This 
follows a wider trend: over 90% of new European HRS are capable of refuelling HDVs, in sharp contrast to 2019, when 70% of new HRS were only capable of 
refuelling passenger cars. The share of stations in Europe that can service HDVs has increased from 27% in 2019 to almost 40% in 2023.17* The United States is 17 Capability here could refer to either the ability to physically accommodate the larger vehicles, having a 350-bar dispenser (as is typically used by HDVs), greater hydrogen storage for the larger anticipated demand, or a combination of factors.  
 
Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 45  
Outside of China, almost 340 new HRS are planned in the coming years. These include stations delivered through partnerships between OEMs and station 
developers to help increase demand, such as by Stellantis (Vauxhall) in the United Kingdom, Toyota and Hyundai jointly in Australia, and Nikola through their HYLA brand in the United States. Further HRS installations have also been announced by companies in Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand and the 
United Kingdom. However, in the coming years, by far the greatest number of stations are likely to be built in China, which has the ambition of reaching 1 200 stations in 2025. This includes 5 provinces and municipal cities each with plans to reach 100 HRS or more, and both upward and downward revisions to previously announced plans based on the progression of deployment.  
Box 2.3 
The past year proves difficult for hydrogen refuelling stations in Europe and North America  
The past year has seen a series of announcements that suggest a slowdown in the deployment of HRS, and the closure of many existing stations in a number of 
countries. Everfuel announced the closure of their Danish stations in September 2023, and Shell followed by closing their California stations in February 2024, after having closed their UK stations in October 2022. Everfuel reported low demand as being behind the closures, leaving a fleet of 100 Danish hydrogen taxis without access to hydrogen refuelling, while Shell cited hydrogen supply issues, but common to both was a refocusing away from cars to the HDV segment. Even in the relatively strong bus sector, HRS plans are being cancelled due to lack of demand, such as in Edmonton, Canada, or are experiencing substantial delays, such as in Crawley, United Kingdom.  
Another sign that the industry may be struggling to grow was the number of selloffs of hydrogen refuelling businesses. In October 2023, UK-based ITM Power sold its joint venture Motive Fuels, and in July 2024, French company McPhy finalised the sale of their HRS business. In June 2024, Norway-based Nel spun off their HRS business into a separate entity, Cavendish Hydrogen, which will focus on HDV refuelling. These companies all noted that the changes were motivated by a desire to concentrate on their core business of electrolysers.  
Shaping these trends are three main challenges – low demand, reliability issues and drastic increases in hydrogen prices – which apply across all regions to 
differing extents.  
Sales of fuel cell passenger cars have not taken off in Europe, leaving much of the costly infrastructure underutilised, and in California, where sales have been more 

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand

substantial, frequent station downtime has damaged consumer sentiment. 
However, it is the widely reported jump in hydrogen price that may be most damaging: in California, hydrogen pump price increased by over 100% between 
2021 and the end of 2023. This issue was most serious in California, but to mitigate similar issues occurring in Europe, H2 Mobility introduced dynamic pricing, whereby the price varies by the origin of the hydrogen, as well as the size and pressure level of the station. This allowed their renewable hydrogen sale price (approximately USD 10.3/kg for trucks and buses, or USD 11.9/kg for cars and vans), to be 25-30% cheaper than the standard price as of October 2023.

Shipping 
Hydrogen-based fuels are anticipated to play an important role in reaching the targets of the recently revised International Maritime Organization (IMO) GHG 
strategy, including that zero or “near-zero” emissions fuels account for 5-10% of international shipping fuel consumption in 2030. A significant fraction of those fuels are expected to be biofuels, but if all this demand were met with hydrogen-based fuels, it could represent 4-9.3 Mtpa in hydrogen-equivalent terms 

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 47  
(Mtpa H2-eq). Given that these targets will come into force in 2027, it may be difficult to achieve the necessary ramp-up in production to achieve the volumes of low-emissions fuels required. However, the orderbook for alternative-fuel-ready vessels has been growing, with over 290 methanol-fuelled vessels, almost 30 ammonia-fuelled vessels, and around 30 hydrogen vessels on order as of September 2024. The majority of methanol vessels on order are container ships, whereas bulk carriers and tankers dominate orders for ammonia-fuelled vessels. 
The orderbook for hydrogen-fuelled vessels is characterised by smaller vessels such as tugs, cruise ships and ferries.  
Each of the top ten largest shipping companies by market capitalisation now has emissions reductions targets of varying levels. In addition, at COP 28, the Green Hydrogen Catapult (a non-profit organisation working to leverage multi-sector opportunities to simultaneously scale supply and demand of renewable hydrogen) partnered with the UN High-Level Climate Champions to co-ordinate a Call to Action with Shipping Leaders. This includes a non-binding commitment to increase maritime fuels derived from renewable hydrogen to 11 million tonnes by 2030.  
Governments have also started to take action on this front, with the most noteworthy example being the adoption of the FuelEU Maritime regulation, although the effect on near-term demand for e-fuels is uncertain, given that the policy does not mandate their use before 2030. Instead, the regulation by the 
European Council establishes a potential sub-target of 2% of RFNBOs in shipping by 2034. Meeting this target would represent demand for 90-105 kt H2-eq in that year. The inclusion of shipping in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme also creates incentives for deploying low-emissions fuels for both domestic and international shipping voyages that originate or terminate in the region.  

Assuming that 9 700 PJ of fuel is consumed in international shipping in 2030 as in the IEA Stated Polices Scenario. The lower bound of the range represents the demand for hydrogen needed to meet the 5% target with hydrogen directly and the upper bound represents the demand for hydrogen needed to produce methanol to meet the 10% target.  
“Fuel-ready” refers to vessel designs that have the flexibility and capability to enable a future conversion to an alternative fuel. Such designs are meant to facilitate future modifications; fuel-ready vessels may still require installation of the new fuel system.  
Includes both hydrogen internal combustion and hydrogen fuel cell vessels. 
E-fuels are produced using electrolytic hydrogen and include e-ammonia, e-methanol, and others.  
FuelEU Maritime establishes targets to decrease the CO2 emissions intensity of maritime fuels; the sub-target of 2% will enter into force only if RFNBOs do not reach 1% of total energy consumption in shipping by 2031. Even in the absence of such sub-targets, there is likely to be significant demand for these fuels due to the overarching target of a 14.5% GHG intensity reduction by 2035.  
Assuming that 1 100 PJ of shipping fuel consumption in the European Union in 2034 is covered by FuelEU Maritime, as per the IEA Stated Policies Scenario. The lower bound of the range represents the demand for hydrogen needed to meet the 2% target with hydrogen directly and the upper bound represents the demand for hydrogen needed to produce methanol to meet the 2% target. Included in the calculation, as per the regulation, is a multiplier of 2 applied to the energy content of RFNBO, reducing the actual mass of fuel required to meet the target. 

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 48  
Beyond the deployment of vessels and the supply of hydrogen-based fuels, the development of technologies and regulations to support alternative fuel bunkering are also needed.
Methanol 
Methanol ships are leading the way in terms of alternatively-fuelled vessels (excluding liquefied natural gas [LNG]), due to their higher technological and commercial readiness, and greater ease of handling when compared to ammonia – there are already around 50 methanol-ready vessels in operation today. About half of existing dual-fuel methanol vessels are oil/chemical tankers, but about two-thirds of the methanol-fuelled vessels on order for the future are container ships. Today, limited supplies of low-emissions methanol limits the use of the fuel in existing dual-fuel vessels. Offtake agreements, mainly for biomethanol or methanol from unspecified sources, indicate that the supply of methanol for these vessels will grow over this decade. There have also been a few promising announcements relating to methanol produced using low-emissions hydrogen. 
Goldwind has signed an agreement to provide A.P. Møller-Mærsk with 500 ktpa of low-emissions methanol to be produced in China, sufficient to fuel 12 large 
methanol-enabled vessels, with initial production slated for 2026. Ørsted has received USD 100 million in funding from the US DoE to support an e-methanol 
project that could produce up to 300 kt of e-methanol in the Gulf Coast region of Texas. However, in August 2024, Ørsted scrapped the FlagshipONE e-methanol 
project in Sweden that they had acquired from Liquid Wind, due to a lack of long-term offtake agreements. Liquid Wind has another two similar projects under 
development, FlagshipTWO and FlagshipTHREE, each of which aims to produce 100 ktpa of e-methanol with operation due to start before 2030. However, given 
the company’s change in priorities to focus on hydrogen, the successful completion of these projects is uncertain, although their original developer (Liquid 
Wind) has recently signed an agreement with Uniper to boost the development of facilities for the production of low-emissions methanol. 
Beyond the availability of low-emissions methanol, regulations around refuelling vessels with methanol are a pre-requisite for widespread operation of methanol-fuelled vessels. In 2023, Gothenburg became the world’s first port to publish operating regulations for methanol fuelling of vessels, and to perform methanol ship-to-ship bunkering of a non-tanker vessel. Two of the largest ports in terms of fuel bunkering, the Ports of Singapore and Rotterdam, have also successfully conducted methanol bunkering operations of a Mærsk-owned container ship.

The upcoming Energy Technology Perspectives 2024 report examines considerations for establishing methanol and ammonia bunkering infrastructure at ports. 
While LNG (which could also be produced synthetically using electrolytic hydrogen) is often considered in the definition of alternative fuels for shipping, this report focuses on methanol, ammonia and direct use of hydrogen, as these are anticipated to be the hydrogen-based fuels that play the largest role in decarbonising the shipping sector. 
E-methanol is produced using electrolytic hydrogen.

Ammonia 
Ammonia-fuelled vessels are at an earlier stage of development than methanol-fuelled vessels, with safety regulations for the use of ammonia as a fuel for ships still to be established. While various classification societies have published guidance on the design and construction of ammonia-fuelled vessels, the IMO International Code of Safety for Ships Using Gases or Other Low Flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code) does not yet cover the use of ammonia as a fuel, though interim guidelines are nearing finalisation. Nevertheless, ammonia-fuelled engines for maritime applications have been tested, and vessel trials are already underway or being planned.  
Notable developments include Wärtsilä launching the shipping industry's first commercial 4-stroke ammonia engine (see Chapter 5. Investment, finance and 
innovation), while engine manufacturer MAN Energy Solutions expects the commercial sale of ammonia engines to begin in 2027. In March 2024, liquid 
ammonia was loaded onto a dual-fuel vessel, and the first onboard combustion of ammonia and diesel was successfully trialled in Singapore. In Japan, an LNG-
fuelled tugboat has been retrofitted to run on ammonia, with combustion tests indicating minimal nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia slip. Another design being 
explored is onboard cracking of ammonia for use in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, which could allow for future direct use of hydrogen. 
As ammonia is already a traded commodity, much like methanol, a number of ports have existing storage and transfer infrastructure. Ship-to-ship ammonia 
transfers are taking place, while in Norway, safety permits have been granted for the construction of an ammonia bunkering facility. The Port of Rotterdam also expects to be bunkering ammonia in 2027. However, further work is needed in standards development for the safe bunkering and use of ammonia as fuel for 
ships. Innovation in refuelling methods also continues, including a truck-to-ship refuelling system. 
Hydrogen A number of hydrogen vessels have been put into operation, particularly for short-range applications. China launched its first hydrogen fuel cell ship in 2023, and a liquefied hydrogen ferry has been commercially operating in Norway since 2023. 
A hydrogen fuel cell barge was launched in 2023 in the Netherlands, and another completed trials in March 2024. A US hydrogen-powered ferry has begun 
commercial operations following successful tests for a 6-month pilot. In Japan, a hybrid hydrogen and biodiesel vessel completed a certification voyage in April 2024.

Projects have demonstrated a number of different hydrogen technologies in vessels, as well as hydrogen fuelling operations. In addition, BeHydro’s dual-fuel 
technology has received approval in principle from the classification society Lloyd's Register, a further sign that the technology is moving from demonstration to commercial application.  
Additional projects are planned that will further build experience with hydrogen-powered vessels, especially larger vessels. These include two large hydrogen ferries (120-car capacity) that are being built in Norway for delivery in 2026, and a hydrogen barge demonstrator expected to be deployed in Paris in 2024. Belgium-based shipping company CMB. Tech is constructing four hydrogen-powered cargo vessels in Viet Nam, which are expected to be delivered in the second half of 2025 and be deployed on major sea routes including northern Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa and West Africa. Elsewhere, as part of the SeaShuttle project, construction of the world's first hydrogen-powered short-sea containership, powered by 3.2 MW hydrogen fuel cells, began in February 2024 at the Cochin shipyard in India. Announcements from Switzerland and the Netherlands demonstrate the geographical diversity of projects in this space.  
Aviation In the short to medium term, hydrogen-related activity in aviation is expected to be concentrated in the production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). The uptake of these fuels is easier than less advanced technologies (like the direct use of hydrogen) as they can be dropped-in with relatively minimal changes to fuel storage infrastructure and aircraft.  
Moreover, there are a growing number of firm commitments to offtake hydrogen-based aviation fuels, with several having taken place since the release of GHR 
2023. In November 2023, Air France-KLM invested USD 4.7 million in DG Fuels, including an option to purchase 75 ktpa of SAF over a period of several years 
starting in 2029. In January 2024, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Cargolux Airlines International S.A. committed to purchase 140 kt in total of synthetic fuels from Norsk e-Fuel. Finally, in February 2024, IAG reached an agreement with e-fuels producer Twelve to purchase 785 kt of SAF in total, with first deliveries as early as 2025. Most of these agreements involve companies operating in Europe, where policies such as the mandates established by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation (1.2% of fuel use to be met with RFNBOs by 2030) are stimulating action in the sector, despite some concerns among aviation companies about the security of supply of these fuels.

An Approval in Principle is an independent assessment of conceptual and innovative shipbuilding within an agreed framework, confirming that the ship design is feasible and that no significant obstacles exist to prevent the concept from being realised. 
Here, SAF includes both biofuels and hydrogen-based synthetic fuels which are produced from low-emissions hydrogen and a carbon source from biogenic origin or from direct air capture. Hydrogen is also considered a SAF and is used in the production of certain biofuels, such as in the case of hydrogenated vegetable oils. 

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 51  
The industry also faces headwinds such as the announcement from Vattenfall and Shell to pause collaboration on their HySkies project in Sweden, which had aimed to produce 82 ktpa of e-SAF. Meeting the ReFuelEU Aviation mandate in 2030 would require 0.6 Mt of synthetic kerosene (0.3 Mt H2-eq) in that year. The three aforementioned projects could account for 0.25 Mt of fuel production in 2030, or close to half of the ReFuelEU target. 
In addition, sectoral coalitions of private companies have been launched to aggregate demand for SAF through the joint purchase of SAF certificates. 
Although this is not exclusively for hydrogen-based SAF (the certificates also include biofuels), it can help to scale uptake. Aggregating purchase power in this way increases the size of the funds raised, which can then be channelled to invest in new production facilities that sell their fuels in the general market. Examples include the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (which in April 2024 undertook the largest-ever collective purchase of SAF certificates, with close to 20 businesses spending nearly USD 200 million on certificates) and the Qantas Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition, which recently expanded its membership.  
Direct use of hydrogen in aircraft is still in development, and given that the industry has strict regulations, any novel hydrogen aircraft are likely to spend a long time at the demonstration phase before seeing commercial use (see Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation). One of the best-known hydrogen aircraft development programmes is Airbus ZEROe, which investigates hydrogen combustion and fuel cells, and in January 2024 they opened a centre in Germany focusing on cryogenic liquefied hydrogen storage and delivery. Airbus also partners with other companies working to advance fuel cells for use in aviation. 
However, most announcements in this space come from start-ups such as Fokker Next Gen, which aims to build liquefied hydrogen-powered narrow-body jets, or 
hydrogen aircraft propulsion manufacturer ZeroAvia. Though still at the business development stage, ZeroAvia have demonstrated sufficient progress to generate orders for their fuel cell-based powertrains, which currently target retrofits of the 10-20 and 40-80 seater aircraft sizes.  
However, these start-up companies face multiple challenges, as evidenced by the announced closure of the high-profile Universal Hydrogen project, in spite of having achieved significant technical milestones. Their novel approach was for a modular liquefied hydrogen fuel storage system, but developing this system while also retrofitting aircraft proved costly. The company was unable to develop a sustainable business model and failed to secure additional investment.  

Assuming 2 200 PJ of fuel is consumed in aviation in the European Union in 2030 as per the IEA Stated Policies Scenario and that the target is met using synthetic kerosene.  
Assuming that the announced total volumes are delivered equally across 5 years including 2030.  

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand

Although Schiphol airport (Netherlands) is aiming to facilitate the first hydrogen-powered international flight in 2024, the earliest significant use of hydrogen in the aviation industry has been in powering ground vehicles. The intention is to develop infrastructure that could later benefit hydrogen planes, though the fact that applications for both gaseous and liquefied hydrogen are being developed presents a risk to this strategy. Overlapping consortia aiming to test, develop, and establish hydrogen as a fuel for use in airports have been established in New Zealand, North America, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, where Bristol Airport has made substantial progress and had completed some tests by April 2024.  
Hydrogen is also being considered for non-conventional aviation applications where it offers sufficient energy density and potential emissions reductions. 
Examples include a cartridge-based fuel storage solution for a prototype unmanned aerial vehicle, and two vertical take-off and landing aircraft, one in 
Australia and one in Switzerland.  
Other non-road sectors 
Rail 
Hydrogen fuel cell trains are being trialled in a diverse range of settings, and a recent review includes 15 hydrogen rail trials announced between 2018 and 2024 to assess its suitability for local (Japan), intercity (India), and freight trains (Austria). Hydrogen trains also continue to set records for distance travelled on a single refuel – 2 803 km versus 244 km for a battery-powered version – demonstrating their potential advantages. In addition, rail operators in France, Italy and the United States have placed orders for battery-hydrogen trains in the past year.  
However, there are still significant headwinds for hydrogen in rail, with many projects being cancelled or failing to make progress. The earliest of the 
aforementioned trials, by the German rail operator in Lower Saxony, has since opted for battery electric trains as the technology of choice for decarbonisation. Another operator in Austria has dropped their plans to adopt hydrogen trains in favour of battery electric less than 1 year after endorsing the technology, while tenders for hydrogen trains in Romania and the Netherlands did not receive any bids. These announcements suggest a trend towards electrification as the most common path towards decarbonising railways.  
Industrial, heavy, and other machinery Low-emissions hydrogen is an attractive option for decarbonising applications that combine the need for remote, continuous operation with a high-power demand.

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 53  
At the smaller end of the scale are forklifts, where hydrogen continues to see significant uptake, with approximately 69 000 in the United States alone, up from around 60 000 in 2022. The technology required is mature and cost-effective, offering the higher uptime required and therefore often offering a favourable total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to alternatives, with companies such as Plug making frequent new announcements in this space.  
At the other end of the scale in terms of size are machines such as excavators, with Applied Hydrogen powering a 30-tonne machine with fuel cells, in what is another step towards widespread decarbonisation of construction equipment. In the mining sector, where remote, extremely heavy operations are common, 
Liebherr is developing both a hydrogen-powered and battery electric version of their haul truck, while Komatsu are also developing a hydrogen haul truck based on their existing battery electric solution.  
In other applications in which heavy-duty, continuous operations appear to favour hydrogen, such as in port handling equipment, the role of hydrogen is still to be seen. The Port of Valencia in Spain, and the Port of Los Angeles in the United States, are pioneering hydrogen-powered cargo-handling equipment, with the latter introducing the world’s first hydrogen rubber-tyred gantry crane building on their Shore to Store project.  
Buildings The contribution of hydrogen to meeting energy demand and supporting decarbonisation in the buildings sector remains negligible, with no significant developments in 2023. Electrification, district heating and distributed renewables are well ahead of hydrogen technologies in fulfilling this need. Under current policies, the role of hydrogen is expected to remain marginal in the future, reaching just 20 ktpa by 2030 (0.002% of total energy demand in the sector), while in the NZE Scenario, global hydrogen use meets only around 0.13% of total demand in buildings by 2030. 
There has been little progress in 2023 on the deployment of technologies that might run on hydrogen. Where fuel cells are installed – mostly in Europe, Japan, Korea and the United States – they predominantly run on natural gas, which is pre-reformed into hydrogen in the fuel cell before being used to produce heat and power. In Japan, thanks to the ENE-FARM project, the stock of deployed fuel cell micro-combined heat and power (CHP) units surpassed 500 000 at the end of 2023, even though yearly installations have declined by more than 15% year-on-year.
  
Fuel cell forklifts still remain a niche technology with over 190 000 electric forklifts expected to be sold in 2024 alone.  

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 54  
Fuel cells running on pure hydrogen (supplied by a refinery) were installed in an apartment building complex in Korea in mid-2024, and provided 840 MWh of 
electricity in June 2024, as well as some heat. Other advances in the use of pure hydrogen in buildings, mostly in boilers, are limited to a very small number of pilots and demonstration projects. In Hoogeveen, a pilot to use hydrogen to provide space heating to 12 homes received the green light from the Netherlands’ Authority for Consumers and Markets after 1 year of delay. In Fife (Scotland), the 300-home hydrogen heating trial that was expected 
to be launched in the second half of 2024 has been delayed amid supply chain challenges. Some of these pilots face low social acceptance, which can 
significantly delay further demonstration projects showcasing the use of hydrogen in buildings – continuing the trend seen last year. For example, in May 2024, the UK government shelved plans for Britain’s largest trial using hydrogen for heating, a decision that came after already abandoning plans for two smaller hydrogen trials, in Redcar and in Whitby, Cheshire.  
Electricity generation  
Hydrogen use for electricity generation currently represents less than 0.2% of the global generation mix (largely not from pure hydrogen, but rather mixed gases containing hydrogen from steel production, refineries or petrochemical plants). 
Hydrogen and ammonia can become an important source of low-emissions electricity system flexibility and are among only a few options for large-scale and 
seasonal electricity storage. The contribution to total electricity generation is, however, likely to be limited. In the NZE Scenario, hydrogen and ammonia 
combined account for less than 2% of global electricity generation in 2050. 
Various technology options exist to use hydrogen-rich gas or even pure hydrogen for electricity (and combined heat) generation: fuel cells, internal combustion engines and gas turbines. Since the release of GHR 2023 (September 2023), the Korean company Hanwha demonstrated at the end of 2023 100%-hydrogen firing in an 80-MW gas turbine, with nitrogen oxide emissions at less than 9 ppm without any specific flue gas treatment. Earlier in 2023, the company had already achieved a 60% hydrogen co-firing share (in volumetric terms). In November 2023, a 30%-hydrogen co-firing share was demonstrated in a grid-connected 566-MW combined-cycle gas turbine in Japan. Gas turbine manufacturers aim to provide modern gas turbines (using dry low nitrogen oxides [NOx] combustion systems) operating on 100% hydrogen by 2030. 
Interest in using hydrogen and ammonia as fuels in the power sector continues to grow, with several projects announced in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America. In the near term, the use of hydrogen and ammonia can reduce emissions from existing plants, while in the longer term, power plants running entirely on hydrogen or ammonia could provide flexibility to the electricity system, 
in combination with large-scale hydrogen storage.

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 55  
Co-firing of ammonia in coal-fired power plants has been successfully demonstrated in trials in Japan, China and Indonesia (see Chapter 5. Investment, 
finance and innovation). In June 2024, JERA, the largest power utility in Japan, successfully demonstrated 20% co-firing of ammonia at its 1-GW Hekinan coal 
power plant, with low NOx emissions JERA plans to start 20% ammonia co-firing in commercial operations in 2027. At the end of 2023, China Energy Investment 
Corporation announced successful trials of ammonia co-firing at its 600 MW Guoneng Taishan coal power plant. Around the same time, in Indonesia, PT Indo 
Raya Tenaga tested ammonia co-firing at its Jawa 9 and Jawa 10 coal power plants (1 000 MW each), which are capable of co-firing up to 60% of ammonia. 
The direct use of 100% ammonia in gas turbines has already been demonstrated in a 2 MW gas turbine in 2022, with N2O emissions being kept at low levels (0.1 
ppm). Demonstration efforts are also underway in larger gas turbines, potentially up to 400 MW by 2030. IHI and GE Vernova are working on retrofittable ammonia combustion systems for existing gas turbines, aiming to address the formation of NOx emissions when burning ammonia and to test the combustor at existing gas turbines in Singapore.  
Projects using hydrogen and ammonia in electricity generation 
At the end of 2023, global installed power capacity using hydrogen and ammonia totalled around 330 MW, with Asia-Pacific accounting for more than 50%, followed by North America with around 30% and Europe with 15% (Figure 2.12). Based on announced projects, the power capacity using hydrogen and ammonia could reach 7 100 MW by 2030 (5 200 MW if projects at very early stages of development are excluded). Compared to the corresponding capacity identified 
in the GHR 2023, this represents a 24% increase. Almost half of the announced capacity is located in the Asia-Pacific region, followed by Europe, accounting for around 40% of the announced capacity by 2030. The share of North America falls to around 10%, despite a tenfold increase in announced absolute capacity 
compared to today, which reaches 900 MW in North America by 2030, but is surpassed by project announcements in Europe, with 2 800 MW, and the Asia-
Pacific region, with 3 400 MW. 

Announced projects include plants that are under construction, have reached FID, are under feasibility study or at an earlier development stages. 
In the case of co-firing hydrogen or ammonia, the capacity corresponds to the total installed capacity multiplied by the co-firing share in energy terms. 

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 56  
The list of announced projects includes some projects aiming to use 100% hydrogen. In the United States, Duke Energy is converting an existing 83 MW gas 
turbine for 100% hydrogen use. The peaking gas turbine is planned to come online in 2024 and will be linked to renewable hydrogen production from solar PV and hydrogen storage tanks. In France, the HYFLEXPOWER project demonstrated in October 2023 the operation of a 12 MW gas turbine on 100% renewable hydrogen, 
also linked to a local electrolyser and hydrogen storage tanks. In the United Kingdom, a 49.5 MW CHP plant has been announced for 2025, running on 
100% hydrogen and being potentially extended to 125 MW by 2028. 
With regards to technologies, existing hydrogen-fuelled capacity is dominated by fuel cells, representing 60% of the installed capacity, while gas turbines and combined-cycle gas turbines account for the remainder. Considering announced projects in the pipeline, gas turbines and combined-cycle gas turbines reach a share of two-thirds in 2030. Co-firing of ammonia in coal power plants is today limited to a few trials, but could represent around 15% of the announced capacity for 2030, with nine projects being developed in the Asia-Pacific region. 
The global hydrogen- and ammonia-fired capacity from announced projects represents almost a quarter of the installed capacity deployed in the Announced 
Pledges Scenario by 2030 (30 GW), but only 6% of the capacity in the NZE Scenario (120 GW).

additionally, several utilities have announced plans to build new gas power plants that are “H2-ready”, or to upgrade existing plants to be able to co-fire a certain share of hydrogen, although the majority have not yet announced fixed dates for starting co-firing. The hydrogen share of this H2-ready announced capacity would correspond to 3 900 MW, but this number is likely to represent a lower range, given that it is based only on projects for which relevant information has been released. In addition, other new gas-fired power plants in planning are also likely to be able to co-fire a certain amount of hydrogen, although no information has been made available yet. Likewise, existing gas-fired power plants are able to co-fire certain shares of hydrogen, varying from 10% to 100%, depending on the gas turbine design. Based on information on existing gas turbines in operation, and 
their maximum hydrogen blending shares as specified by gas turbine manufacturers, their hydrogen-fired capacity could amount to more than 80 GW globally. As before, this represents a lower bound, given that detailed information was only available for 480 GW of the existing total gas-fired capacity of 2 000 GW 
in 2023.  
Auctions for hydrogen-based electricity generation 
Several countries have taken steps to support the use of hydrogen and ammonia in the power sector, including through auctions.  
Korea held tenders in 2023 for electricity generated from hydrogen with a combined volume of 1 430 GWh, without any constraints on the emissions intensities of the hydrogen. A tender for up to 6 500 GWh electricity produced from clean hydrogen and ammonia was launched in May 2024, for generation starting 
in 2028 with contracts running for 15 years. For this tender, hydrogen and ammonia have to meet Korea’s “clean” hydrogen definition, which has four 
emissions intensities tiers in the range of 0.1-4 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. For hydrogen and ammonia produced from fossil fuels with CCS to be eligible, the capture rate has to be higher than 90%. 
In January 2024, Japan held its first auction for long-term zero-emissions power capacity for various clean electricity sources, including hydrogen and ammonia. The winners comprise five coal-fired power plants planning to co-fire ammonia, with a combined ammonia-fired capacity of 770 MW (corresponding to an average ammonia co-firing share of 20% for the combined coal capacity of 3 850 MW [net capacity, 4 100 MW gross capacity]), plus 55 MW for a gas-fired power plant with hydrogen co-firing. The submitted bids stayed below the targeted capacity of 1 000 MW, such that all bids were awarded funding at a fixed cost for 20 years, if the project starts by FY2030-2031.

The estimate of the H2-ready capacity is based on individual plant announcements and does not include planned auctions for H2-ready capacity, which are discussed in the following section. 
Other factors, such as the capability of the gas supply pipes and valves to handle certain hydrogen blending shares are not considered here, but are, of course, critical to assessing specific plants. 
Derived by taking the maximum co-firing share multiplied by the total capacity for individual plants. 

Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand 
PAGE | 58  
In 2023, Germany announced plans for three tenders for hydrogen-ready or directly hydrogen-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 24 GW. As part 
of the country’s power plant strategy, these plans were scaled back to 12.5 GW in July 2024. In a first phase, 5 GW of new hydrogen-ready gas-fired capacity and 2 GW of hydrogen-ready retrofits for existing plants will be tendered. Plants must switch to hydrogen after the eighth year of operation (for new plants) or after the modernisation to hydrogen firing (for existing plants). Winners of the tenders will benefit from support with capital cost and operational subsidies for the cost difference between natural gas and hydrogen for 800 hours per year. In addition, support for 500 MW of capacity running immediately on hydrogen is being planned. The first tenders are being planned for early 2025. In a second phase, a further 5 GW of new gas-fired capacity will be tendered.  
In 2023, Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority and the Energy Market Authority issued a tender for the development of an ammonia-fired 55-65 MW gas turbine or combined-cycle gas turbine, using imported low-emissions ammonia. Two consortia out of six shortlisted proposals were selected in July 2024, one led by Keppel and another by Sembcorp. After engineering studies have been conducted, a lead project developer will be selected in 2025.

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 59  
Highlights 
 Hydrogen production reached 97 Mt in 2023, of which less than 1% was low-emissions. Based on announced projects, low-emissions hydrogen could reach 
49 Mtpa by 2030 (up from 38 Mtpa in the Global Hydrogen Review 2023).  
 Installed water electrolyser capacity reached 1.4 GW by the end of 2023 and could reach 5 GW by the end of 2024. China leads in terms of committed projects 
and could account for almost 70% of 2024 capacity. Announced projects suggests that capacity could grow to close to 520 GW by 2030, although only 
4% has reached a final investment decision (FID) or is under construction. For fossil-based production with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), 
14% of the announced potential production has reached FID, boosted by an acceleration of FIDs in the last 12 months. Progress is being made, albeit far 
more slowly than was expected a few years ago. 
 Around 6.5 GW of electrolyser capacity reached FID in the past 12 months, nearly 12% less than in the 12 months prior to GHR 2023. More than 40% of 
this capacity is in China and 32% in Europe, where there was a four-fold increase compared to the previous 12 months. Committed projects are mainly 
in industry, or to produce hydrogen-based fuels for transport. On the other hand, several projects have been cancelled due to uncertainty about demand 
or regulations, financial hurdles, licencing and permitting issues.  
 Electrolyser manufacturing capacity doubled in 2023 to reach 25 GW/yr, with China accounting for 60%. This capacity is heavily underutilised, with only 
2.5 GW of output in 2023. Considering projects with FID or under construction, capacity could reach more than 40 GW/yr in 2024. The project pipeline to 2030 
adds up to more than 165 GW/yr, of which 30% has reached FID. 
 Producing renewable hydrogen today is generally one-and-a-half to six times more costly than unabated fossil-based production. This cost premium is much 
lower further down the value chain; for consumers, it typically represents only a few percentage points on final products (for example, it is around 1% for 
electric vehicles with steel produced using renewable hydrogen), but acceptance of higher prices varies by product. 
 Around 40% of planned low-emissions hydrogen production projects are in water-stressed regions, where using diverse sources of water and managing 
them sustainably will be crucial. Project developers are exploring large-scale desalination and treated wastewater to secure sufficient water supplies.

Overview and outlook 
Hydrogen production today 
Global hydrogen supply increased by 2.5% in 2023 compared to 2022, to reach 97 Mt H2 (Figure 3.1). Demand was primarily met by domestic production in 
industrial hubs, with minimal international trade. China leads in terms of production, accounting for almost 30% of the global total, followed by the 
United States and Middle East with 14% each, and India with 9%. We estimate that global production will keep growing to meet increasing demand, and could 
approach 100 Mt H2 by the end of 2024.

RoW = rest of world; 2024e= estimate for 2024. The estimated value for 2024 is a projection based on trends observed until June 2024. 
Global hydrogen production reached 97 Mt in 2023, practically all derived from unabated fossil fuels. China is the largest producer of hydrogen worldwide. 
Hydrogen production is today largely dependent on unabated fossil fuels, continuing the trend of recent years, and this is expected to remain mostly 
unchanged in 2024. The unabated natural gas route dominates, accounting for around two-thirds of total production. The Middle East is a key player – it produces 20% of all the hydrogen from unabated natural gas – with the United States and China together contributing around one-quarter. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 61  
unabated coal gasification accounted for 20% of the global total in 2023, and is predominantly located in China. In addition, more than 15% of hydrogen globally is produced as a by-product in refineries and in the petrochemical industry, from processes such as naphtha reforming. 
Low-emissions hydrogen production has grown marginally over the past 2 years and remains under 1 Mtpa H2 – accounting for less than 1% of global production. 
This low-emissions hydrogen relies mostly on production from fossil fuels with CCUS. Electrolytic hydrogen production still makes up only a very small share of the total, remaining below 100 kt H2 in 2023, and is primarily located in China, Europe and the United States, which together account for around 75% of global electrolytic hydrogen production. 
Outlook to 2030 
More and more projects for the production of low-emissions hydrogen have been announced since the previous edition of the Global Hydrogen Review (GHR 2023), 
resulting in a more promising outlook to 2030. Annual production of low-emissions hydrogen could reach 49 Mtpa H2 by 2030, an increase of more than a quarter on the 38 Mtpa H2 by 2030 reported in last year’s publication (Figure 3.2). If projects at very early stages of development (such as those where only a co-operation agreement among stakeholders has been announced) are excluded, annual production of low-emissions hydrogen could exceed 26 Mtpa H2 by 2030. More than 45% of the projects in terms of potential production volume are undergoing feasibility studies and a similar share are at early stages. Committed projects – i.e. those that have taken FID or are under construction – account for only 7% (3.4 Mtpa) of the new low-emissions hydrogen production announced by 2030, of which 55% is from electrolysis and almost 45% from fossil fuels with CCUS projects. Nevertheless, this is a notable increase from the 4% (1.7 Mtpa) reported in the GHR 2023, driven up in particular by projects using fossil fuels with CCUS, which have seen an acceleration in terms of FIDs in the past year (in the GHR 2023 they accounted for only 35% of the committed capacity). Excluding the projects at very early stages of development, which are less likely to be fully realised by the end of the decade, the share of capacity that has at least reached FID changes to 13%. Approximately two-thirds of low-emissions hydrogen production in 2030 could come from electrolysis, and this could rise to almost 75% if projects at early stage of development are also included.

Hydrogen from chlor-alkali electrolysis is not included in this analysis.

Low-emissions hydrogen production could reach 49 Mtpa by 2030, although only 7% of new projects has at least reached FID – a notable increase from the 4% reported in the GHR 2023. 
Europe (with 25%), Latin America (15%) and the United States (15%) together account for more than half of the potential low-emissions hydrogen production by 
2030. In Europe, nearly 8 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen could be generated via electrolysis by 2030 (more than 5 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of 
development are excluded). Spain (20%), Denmark (12%) and Germany (10%) are leading in terms of announced water electrolysis projects, and could represent 
more than 40% of Europe’s low-emissions hydrogen production by 2030.  
In Australia, hydrogen production from electrolysis could reach almost 6 Mtpa by 2030 (almost 1.5 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of development are 
excluded). The availability of low-cost solar and wind resources, as well as its proximity to the Asian market, could make Australia one of the main exporters of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels (see Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure). A similar trend is noticeable in Chile: according to our tracking, 16 electrolytic hydrogen projects, each with capacity greater than 1 GW, have been announced in Chile, although almost half of the potential capacity is in projects at very early stages of development. Potential production of low-emissions hydrogen from announced projects in Chile reaches almost 4 Mtpa (2 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of development are excluded), representing more than half of the low-emissions electrolytic hydrogen that could be produced in Latin America by 2030 (see Chapter 8. Latin America in focus).

Africa has seen a significant number of announcements for electrolytic hydrogen projects in the past year, potentially increasing production to more than 7 Mtpa by 2030. However, the majority of these projects – close to 6 Mtpa in terms of production – are still at very early stages of development, meaning that their full deployment by 2030 remains somewhat uncertain. This is not the case for China and the Middle East, where most of the announced projects are far more advanced, with half of the announced hydrogen production from water electrolysis in China, and 20% in the Middle East, coming from projects that are currently under construction or have already reached FID.  
Based on announcements, the United States will remain the frontrunner in hydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS, with 5.6 Mtpa H2 by 2030 (more 
than 3.5 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of development are excluded), followed by Europe with more than 3.5 Mtpa H2 by 2030 (more than 3 Mtpa if 
projects at very early stages of development are excluded). This is an increase of almost 30% for the United States since the GHR 2023. In Europe, these projects are primarily located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Norway – all countries with significant potential for CO2 underground storage (Figure 3.3).

A larger number of projects have been announced in Africa, Latin America and India in the past year, while the majority of operational capacity is in China, Europe and the United States. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 64  
Despite the growing number of announced projects for low-emissions hydrogen production, several projects delayed their FID or were even cancelled in the past year in the face of multiple challenges (see Box 3.1). 
The 49 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen production that could get the go-ahead by 2030 represents close to three-quarters (40% if projects at very early stages of development are excluded) of the total low-emissions hydrogen production in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario). An important gap remains to be closed in order to get on track, for which the largest part is accounted for by low-emissions hydrogen from electrolysis, while production from fossil fuels with CCUS is already closer to the value in the NZE Scenario. In contrast, under the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), the low-emissions hydrogen production from announced projects (excluding projects at very early stage of development) could meet the scenario requirements both for electrolysis and for hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCUS. 
Box 3.1 
Challenges facing project developers are hindering faster progress Several project developers aiming to produce low-emissions hydrogen have 
announced project delays, postponements to FIDs and even cancellations. Some of these announcements have come from highly ambitious projects that aimed for 
rapid market and technology developments (such as the adoption of hydrogen in new applications that are not yet commercial or international trade of low-
emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels) or were looking at hydrogen use in applications with weaker business cases, or where more competitive 
alternatives are already commercially available (e.g. light-duty road transport, domestic heating and grid blending). The cancellation of these projects suggests that the sector is now maturing and moving beyond the hype observed in recent years, and that understanding among stakeholders about where the real 
opportunities for hydrogen lie – and where efforts must be focused – is now much stronger.  
However, a large number of projects, even those built on solid use cases for hydrogen, are now facing diverse challenges that are hindering progress in the 
sector. These are the most common barriers facing project developers: 
 Regulatory uncertainty: Project developers require clear and stable regulatory frameworks to secure investments. Although a large number of governments are making progress (see Chapter 6. Policies), on many occasions regulations are not yet clear, which can lead to companies halting their hydrogen programmes or postponing projects while awaiting clarity. 
 Demand uncertainty: The slow development of the market for low-emissions hydrogen and insufficient demand mean that project developers cannot secure 
offtakers to underpin investments. Several delayed and cancelled projects have reported barriers to securing sufficient offtake, in a variety of projects 
including methanol production, ammonia production, synthetic fuels and hydrogen production for multiple end-uses. The challenges in signing offtake 
agreements have recently led to the cancellation of Orsted’s Flagship project (Sweden) for the production of methanol using renewable-based hydrogen, 
even after having taken FID in late 2022 and starting unit assembly earlier this year. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 65
 Financial hurdles and incentive delays: Low-emissions hydrogen production and use cases remain more expensive than the fossil fuel incumbents they could replace. Timely government action to close this cost gap by favouring low-emissions solutions over fossil fuel alternatives (e.g. through carbon pricing, incentives, funding schemes and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies) is critical to help first movers to advance. Governments have started to implement support schemes for the first large-scale projects, but delays in making funding available have led companies to put off or scale back their production targets, or to delay investments in numerous projects. Even projects that had already received public funding have been delayed and cancelled due 
to increases in financing and material costs that completely changed the business case between the time when companies applied for the funding and 
the funding being approved. 
 Licencing and permitting issues: Like the developers of renewable energy projects in the past, several low-emissions hydrogen project developers are 
now struggling to get necessary approvals from authorities, including for access to water supplies and grid connections. Local opposition has also 
complicated the obtention of licences to proceed with the development of projects and, therefore, their future operation. Although the complexity of some 
permitting procedures is often cited as the reason for the delays, bad industry practices (e.g. submission of incomplete files, poor project management) can 
also delay decisions from authorities and impact project plans. In the past year, eleven projects in Inner Mongolia (China), accounting for more than 3 GW 
electrolysis, had their development rights revoked as a result of delays from developers after land acquisition.* 
 Operational challenges: Although several technologies for the production of low-emissions hydrogen are commercially mature, they are now facing the 
scale-up stage. The change in scale this implies requires new project configurations that need to be tested and perfected, through a process that 
presents technical and operational hurdles for developers. For example, Sinopec’s Kuqa project, the world’s largest operational electrolysis plant 
(260 MW), inaugurated in 2023, has faced operational issues with its electrolysers, limiting production, and is not expected to operate at full capacity 
until 2025. Other projects operating at a smaller scale have been delayed (20 MW project in Denmark) or put out of action (2.5 MW in Spain) for long 
periods after commissioning due to equipment faults. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 66  
These challenges do not occur in isolation, and in multiple cases project developers have reported that a combination of issues was behind their failed 
plans. For example, Uniper delayed the start-up of the first phase (100 MW) of the H2Maasvlakte project in the Netherlands (which had received support from the EU Innovation Fund), after failing to secure a power purchase agreement for the facility, and reporting challenges with high grid fees, uncertainty over sufficient offtake, and barriers with regulatory requirements, as well as complex administrative procedures needed to secure funding from public support schemes.

Electrolysis 
Current status 
Installed water electrolyser capacity reached 1.4 GW at the end of 2023, almost double the installed capacity at the end of 2022. This looks set to grow further: based on announced projects that have at least reached FID or are under construction, global installed capacity could reach 5 GW by the end of 2024. Nevertheless, as of September 2024, only 205 MW of new capacity has started operations. In addition, the installed capacity in 2023 represents only one-sixth of the capacity that was expected based on the announcements for projects at the time that the Global Hydrogen Review 2021 was published, signalling that progress is being made, though far more slowly than was expected just a few years ago.  
China accounted for 80% of the capacity that entered into operation in 2023, including the largest electrolyser project in the world, the 260 MW Kuqa plant by Sinopec. About 12% of the close to 700 MW that came online in 2023 was in Europe. China accounts for three-quarters of the new capacity additions that 
could become operational in 2024, increasing its share of global capacity from 55% in 2023 to almost 70%. Europe and the United States could reach shares 
of 15% and 6%, respectively, of global installed capacity by the end of the year, if all projects are realised on time. In the European Union, if all projects meet their planned timelines, total installed capacity could reach 0.7 GW at the end of 2024, falling very short of the interim target of 6 GW established in the EU Hydrogen Strategy back in 2020. 
Alkaline technology continues to make up the largest share, accounting for more than 60% of the installed electrolyser capacity in 2023, followed by proton 
exchange membrane (PEM) with 22%. Despite their lower share to date, several projects using mid-size PEM electrolysers have started operations in the past few months. At the beginning of 2024, Plug commissioned plants for about 50 MW in total: the Camden County plant in the United States, for hydrogen use in mobility; and the 10 MW electrolyser in the Szazhalombatta refinery in Hungary.

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 67  
Another PEM electrolyser came online in the United States at the end of 2023, the 25 MW Cavendish NextGen Hydrogen Hub at the FPL Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, powered by solar PV for application in the power sector. In Norway, the first phase of Yara’s Porsgrunn (Herøya) project started operating a 24 MW PEM electrolyser in the beginning of 2024, manufactured by ITM Power, for ammonia production.  
When we published the GHR 2023 in September 2023, projects in the pipeline worldwide accounted for 175 GW by 2030, and as much as 420 GW if projects at 
very early stages of development were also included. Taking into account the new announcements made in the past 12 months since then, 230 GW of water 
electrolyser capacity could be reached by 2030, and close to 520 GW if projects at early stages of development are also considered (Figure 3.4). The regional distribution could look quite different to today: regions with good renewable resources, such as Latin America and Africa, could each represent 17% of the installed capacity, up from just 65 MW in total today. Europe could reach more than a quarter of the global share by 2030, and Australia 15%. The decrease in China’s share by 2030 should not be seen as a slow-down in project deployment, nor as evidence of declining interest, but rather as a reflection of short-term visibility of the projects under development in China, and project announcements that typically occur only when the projects are at a relatively advanced stage.

Based on announcements, electrolyser capacity could reach 230 GW by 2030, or up to 520 GW with projects still at early stages of development, from an installed capacity of 1.4 GW in 2023. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 68  
By 2030, three-quarters of the projects could be gigawatt-scale plants, consolidating a trend towards large-scale projects already observed last year. 
However, there is continuing uncertainty about the full development of the announced projects, as more than half of the electrolyser capacity is at early 
stages of development and only 4%, or 20 GW, of electrolyser capacity due to be online by 2030 has either reached FID or is under construction. By excluding the projects at early stages of development, which could be considered to be least likely to be fully realised by the end of the decade, the share of capacity that has at least reached FID rises to 8%. Between 2020 and 2023, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for water electrolyser installation has been around 60%, and if all projects for 2024 are realised on time, the year-on-year increase could be almost 400%. The realisation of all the projects by 2030 would entail a CAGR of more than 100% from 2024 onwards (80% by excluding projects at early stage of development): almost twice as high as any growth experienced by solar PV in any six-year period during the last two decades. 
Advances 
While looking at the entire project pipeline gives a clear indication of the potential growth in electrolyser plants globally, focusing on the projects that are committed provides a better overview of where projects are moving forward, in which sectors, and at what pace. In the 12 months since the GHR 2023 (September 2023), around 6.5 GW of electrolyser projects have reached FID, compared to about 7.5 GW in the 12 months prior to GHR 2023 (Figure 3.5).

China continues to lead on committed investments in electrolyser projects, followed by Europe, with more than 2 GW of projects reaching FID since September 2023. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 69  
Advances in the first half of 2023 were, in part, driven up by the FID of the NEOM Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia, which is by far the largest project to have reached FID, with 2.2 GW of alkaline electrolyser capacity, of which 400 MW have already been installed. This was equal to one-third of all advances in the following period, between September 2023 and August 2024. In that period, more than 2 GW reached FID in Europe, four times more than the previous 12 month period. The first phase of the Grey2Green project developed by GALP (100 MW, Portugal), the Green CCU Hub Aalborg (120 MW, Denmark), the Clean Hydrogen Coastline by EWE (320 MW, Germany) and the Refhyne II by Shell (100 MW, Germany) together represent one-quarter of the capacity that reached FID in 
Europe, while 40% of it is represented by the Stegra (formerly H2 Green Steel) project in Sweden. In addition, in September 2024 RWE took FID on the 300 MW 
GET H2 Nukleus project in Lingen, Germany (not included in Figure 3.5): state aid for this project was approved by the European Union under the Important Projects for Common European Interest scheme. China accounted for 2.8 GW of capacity that secured investment in the same period, retaining its position as the country with the largest share of committed investments. At the same time, India has taken its first big step into the regions with large production capacities committed, with the announcement in August 2024 by AM Green Ammonia of the FID for a 1.3 GW project in Kakinada for the production of ammonia in an existing fertiliser plant.  The majority of the announced capacity that took FID in the past 12 months is for the use of electrolytic hydrogen in industrial applications and for transport fuels (Figure 3.6). Half of this capacity, or 3.2 GW, targets sectors that already use hydrogen today, namely ammonia production, methanol production and the refining sector. These applications are all well placed to adopt low-emissions hydrogen in the near term, as the partial or full switch from fossil-based hydrogen generally requires only minor technical adjustments; they are also the sectors that can already secure offtakes for substantial volumes (see Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand). Of the projects that took FID in the past 12 months, about 0.7 GW are to produce synthetic methanol to be used as a transport fuel in shipping. The biggest projects under development are the Goldwind e-methanol project in China and the Green CCU Hub Aalborg in Denmark, together accounting for a capacity of 0.5 Mtpa of methanol.

Traditional uses of hydrogen in industry and the production of hydrogen-based fuels for transport are the sectors dominating FIDs for electrolyser projects. 
In the United Kingdom, although revenue support is provided through the Hydrogen Allocation Round, no new projects have reached FID since publication 
of the GHR 2023. The first round selected 11 projects in December 2023, for a combined capacity of 125 MW, and could provide up to USD 2.5 billion through a 
combination of revenue support and capital cost support. However, project developers are currently negotiating contracts with the Low Carbon Contracts 
Company (the counterparty designated by the government) and none of them has taken FID so far. A second allocation round is ongoing, with a target to support projects with a total capacity of 875 MW. 
The biggest electrolyser project currently under construction, the 2.2 GW NEOM Green Hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia, took financial closure in May 2023 and plans to start operations in 2026. If this project is used as a proxy indicator, it would suggest that the construction time required for a GW-scale plant is around 3 years (i.e. time between FID and beginning operation, although in the specific case of the NEOM project, construction began a few months before the FID was reached). 
Of all the projects in the pipeline expected to start operation by 2030 and with size equal to or above 1 GW, only four plants (6 GW cumulatively) have already reached FID or are under construction. However, more than 50 projects, for a combined capacity of 125 GW, are currently undergoing feasibility study. If they do not reach FID and start construction by 2027, it is unlikely that they will begin operation by the end of the decade. This means that 25% of the total announced capacity by 2030 is at significant risk of not beginning operation on time (55% if projects at very early stages of development are excluded). 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production

Many electrolyser projects plan to use dedicated renewable electricity generation as the electricity source. The design of the overall system, in particular the sizing of the renewable electricity capacity relative to the electrolyser, will be critical for the hydrogen production costs (Box 3.2).  
Box 3.2 
Impact of optimal sizing of renewable to electrolyser capacity For renewables-based electrolysis projects, achieving high utilisation rates for the 
electrolyser reduces the impact of the electrolyser CAPEX in the overall cost of hydrogen production. For directly connected projects, oversizing the renewable generation capacity relative to the capacity of the electrolyser can be a way to achieve this. This increases the CAPEX spending for renewable electricity generation, but it can help to minimise the overall hydrogen production costs by increasing the utilisation rate of the electrolyser. Optimising the capacity ratio of the renewable plant in combination with other design options such as combining solar PV and wind in a hybrid configuration, and including electricity and/or hydrogen storage, can also lead to a more stable supply of hydrogen or industrial process, which also helps to improve the operation and economics of any subsequent synthesis process. 
Through the Energy Transformation PatHway Optimization Suite (ETHOS) model suite, the optimal renewable-to-electrolyser ratio has been computed for several 
announced project locations around the world, minimising the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) production in each of those locations. For onshore wind, the 
optimal sizing factor is between 1 (such as in the case for locations that already have relatively high capacity factors for wind) and 1.4 in Europe, slightly higher in the United States and Canada, and in the range of 1.6-2.8 for Brazil. In the case of solar PV, this factor is between 1.3 and 1.7 in regions with excellent solar irradiation, such as Chile, Africa and the Middle East, while it reaches a value of 2 in Europe and up to 2.4 in certain locations in China. The optimisation does not take into account other uses of the renewable electricity from the same plant; a higher renewable-to-electrolyser capacity ratio could be expected from projects that plan to use the same renewable electricity plant for multiple purposes besides 
hydrogen production. For example, the Puertollano Green Hydrogen project by Iberdrola, which has a solar PV capacity of 100 MW to power a 20 MW electrolyser, aims to send excess electricity to the local grid.

Change in the method used to determine the electrolyser capacity factor compared to the Global Hydrogen Review 2023 
In previous editions of the GHR, low-emissions hydrogen production from electrolysers using renewable electricity has been computed assuming a 1:1 
capacity ratio of the renewable electricity generation and the electrolyser. This year, the ETHOS modelling suite of the Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany has been used to determine for each project location the optimal sizing of the renewable electricity capacity relative to the electrolyser capacity, taking into account local hourly solar PV and wind profiles and region-specific technology costs. The optimal capacity factors have been applied to projects using solar PV, onshore wind, offshore wind or planning to combine multiple renewables types, for which a hybrid configuration of solar PV and onshore wind has been selected; they account for more than half of the 36 Mtpa that could be produced from electrolysis by 2030. This approach is particularly useful for those projects where no information on the planned renewable capacity has been released. In order to provide values that are comparable with the previous editions of this report, the non-optimised production, i.e. using a 1:1 capacity ratio between the renewable electricity and the electrolyser capacities, is also provided. The difference between the two methodologies is only around 2.2 Mtpa H2.

Renewable to electrolyser capacity ratio from selected announced renewable hydrogen projects

Among the announced projects for the production of hydrogen from electrolysis, several have announced the renewable capacity that will be used to power the 
facility. The solar PV-to-electrolyser capacity ratio is, in many cases, between one and three, with some larger values in the case of projects in Europe. Similar values can be derived for onshore wind in Europe, while the smaller sample for Australia and Latin America shows capacity ratios of one-and-a-half to two and three, respectively. 
Electrolyser manufacturing  
Manufacturing capacity for assembling electrolyser systems had reached 25 GW/yr by the end of 2023, based on the nominal facility size from company announcements. This has almost doubled compared to 2022, with nearly three-quarters of the new additions in China, which accounted for 60% of capacity in 2023, and is expected to maintain this share in the short term (Figure 3.7). Based on announcements that reached FID or are under construction, another 16 GW/yr of capacity could be added in 2024, to reach more than 40 GW/yr of global capacity. The largest share of new additions would be in China, followed by Europe, which could potentially add more than 3 GW/yr. However, based on an estimated output of 2.5 GW in 2023, this manufacturing capacity is currently underutilised; in addition, reaching the assembly capacity expansion envisaged by announced projects will depend on the scale-up of manufacturing capacity of all the components in parallel, for which there is limited visibility.  
By 2030, more than 165 GW/yr of capacity could be reached based on all announcements – almost 30% of this announced capacity has reached FID, and 
another 30% has been announced without a target year for starting operations. 
Considering only the facilities that are expected to enter operation by 2030, the resulting capacity of 116 GW could meet almost two-thirds of the needs in the NZE Scenario.

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 74  
China would continue to account for the largest share – 30% – of manufacturing capacity in 2030, followed by Europe (with 20%) and the United States 
(15%). Around 7% of announcements, for a total 12 GW, were made without a defined location, meaning that the regional distribution of global manufacturing 
capacity could still change by 2030.

Electrolyser manufacturing capacity could grow 60% in 2024, with China maintaining its lead. 
By 2030, more than 165 GW/yr could be operational, but only 30% of announced additions have been committed.  
Alkaline technology continues to dominate, with 55% of the announced capacity by 2030, down from more than 70% of the facilities today, the majority of which is in China. As the Chinese market for electrolysers grows, it is attracting manufacturers from different business areas, such as Trina and Sungrow, who are both active in the solar PV industry, and are now among the largest companies in terms of electrolyser manufacturing capacity. The Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has obtained a patent for electrolyser equipment, signalling that it also sees potential to enter the market. PEM announced capacity is concentrated mainly in Europe, with almost half of the 43 GW/yr by 2030, followed by North America and India, which together have a fifth. The US-based manufacturer Accelera by Cummins has started production of its HyLIZER1000 in China, which with a 5-MW modular unit is the largest PEM 
electrolyser in China in terms of single unit capacity. The Chinese company Tianjin Mainland, traditionally a manufacturer of alkaline electrolysers, is beginning to explore PEM. HydrogenPro has completed manufacturing of the alkaline units for the Advanced Clean Energy Storage hub in the United States and has also started

delivering the units for the Salcos project in Germany, all together accounting for 320 MW planned to be commissioned by the end of 2024.  
Although solid oxide electrolysers (SOEC) represent only about 6% of capacity today and are expected to maintain this share through to 2030 based on announcements, there have been notable recent developments. For example, thyssenkrupp nucera has expanded its product range by signing a strategic partnership with the German research centre Fraunhofer IKTS for commercialisation of the SOEC technology, and plans to open a pilot production line as soon as 2025. American energy service company Baker Hughes has invested in Elcogen, an Estonian SOEC and fuel cell maker. In Denmark, Topsoe will supply the ammonia producer First Ammonia with a 500 MW electrolyser, which should take up a big portion of the company’s 500 MW/yr facility in Herning for the next couple of years before further scale-up. For the US market, a further 1 GW/yr manufacturing facility in Virginia has been announced by Topsoe. Another electrolyser technology that represents a very small share of current manufacturing capacity, but that could reach more than 10% by 2030 if all the 
announcements are realised, is anion exchange membrane (AEM). US-based EvolOH announced plans for a new facility in Lowell, Massachusetts. In addition, 
Enapter, which is one of the largest manufacturers of AEM electrolysers today, saw sales increase around fourfold between the last quarter of 2022 and the last quarter of 2023, confirming the interest of small-scale project developers in this technology. 
The geography of electrolyser manufacturing
Based on current manufacturing capacity, electrolyser orders and announcements for future expansions of facilities, Chinese companies are predominantly expanding manufacturing capacity in China in order to meet domestic demand. Certain European companies are also operating in the Chinese market, mainly through joint ventures or agreements with Chinese companies, such as in the case of the Jigli plant in Suzhou being developed with Belgian company John Cockerill, or the partnership between Norwegian HydrogenPro and Tianjin Mainland in Tianjin. AEM electrolyser manufacturer Enapter announced in 2024 a joint venture with the Chinese company Wolong to move part of their production and assembly to China, though not the manufacturing of the electrolyser stack itself. 
Similarly, the largest European and North American electrolyser manufacturers typically locate the majority of their capacity in their home regions (Figure 3.8) in order to serve domestic demand. In the European Union, the Net Zero Industry Act, with a goal for manufacturing capacity to reach at least 40% of the European Union’s annual deployment needs by 2030, could provide a long-term signal to manufacturers and investors. However, the expansion of some European companies to the United States has been observed recently, thanks to attractive policies – such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), although the finalisation of the technical rules is still pending – for the development of hydrogen projects that can create demand for electrolysers. 
International trade of electrolysers has been limited so far: of 1.4 GW of total installed water electrolysers capacity as of 2023, less than 20% have been shipped internationally. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production

There are some signs of change in the geographical distribution of manufacturing, although whether this will add up to a longer-term trend remains to be seen. Chinese electrolyser manufacturer Guofu Hydrogen Energy Equipment (GuofuHee) announced in 2023 the intention to open a factory in Germany by 2026. Trina Hydrogen, which is headquartered in China, expects to take FID next year for a new facility to be built in Spain, and the Chinese Hygreen Energy has announced in August this year the plan for a facility in Spain together with local firm Coxabengoa. In 2024, Swedish company Metacon was granted rights to manufacture electrolysis systems based on China-based PERIC’s technology. On the electrolyser supply side, the recent results of the European Hydrogen Bank pilot auction show that up to 25% of the projects might procure electrolysers from China based on the submitted letters of intent, while more than half intend to buy from domestic manufacturers in the European Union. With a growing pipeline of electrolysis projects, and the ongoing expansion in manufacturing capacity, trade in electrolysers could represent an opportunity for companies with capacity to enter new markets, especially in those 
regions where there is no manufacturing capacity today.

The cost of electrolysers 
The cost of an installed water electrolyser has increased in past years due to inflation affecting materials and labour costs, and higher interest rates. In 2023, the capital cost for an installed electrolyser (including the equipment, gas treatment, plant balancing, and engineering, procurement and construction cost, and contingencies) ranged between USD 2 000/kW for alkaline and USD 2 450/kW for PEM electrolysers (Figure 3.9). Alkaline electrolysers manufactured in China are cheaper than those produced in Europe or North America in terms of CAPEX, and can reach around USD 750/kW-1 300/kW for an installed system. Compared to the GHR 2023, the capital cost for 2023 has been revised based on newly available data from more advanced projects and to include contingency costs, resulting in an increase of about 20% (BNEF 2024, TNO 2024).

50 GW and 560 GW by 2030 respectively. The learning rate for the electrolyser stack is assumed at 18% based on STORE&GO (2019) Deliverable 7.5, while for the other components of the balance of plant it is 2-10%. For the EPC and installation cost, a learning rate of 8% has been assumed. Electrolyser installed CAPEX is a global average value, with the range representing alkaline and PEM technologies (lower and upper end of the range respectively). The cost 
disaggregation refers to a PEM electrolyser manufactured in the United States. Installation costs include installation, project and commissioning management, temporary site construction facilities, commissioning labour assistance, etc. Other techno-economic assumptions are included in the Annex.

If all announced projects are realised, electrolyser installed capital cost could be reduced by 50-55% by 2030 due to economies of scale and mass manufacturing. 
 
Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 78  
The cost of an installed electrolyser system can be divided into three main components: the stack, the balance of plant and the installation cost. The stack 
cost represents about 50-60% of the uninstalled electrolyser system, with the rest being the power supply unit (including the rectifier), oxygen separator tank, circulation pumps, piping, cooling system, valves, piping and various instrumentation (which is usually referred to as the balance of plant (BoP)). On top of that, installation could account for up to half of the final installed cost. Based on bottom-up calculations and assuming a high utilisation rate of factories, the direct cost of manufacturing an alkaline electrolyser stack could range between USD 45-65/kW (with China at the lower end, and Europe and the United States at the higher end). However, we estimate a low utilisation rate of electrolyser factories today, as demand has not yet scaled up and output was estimated at 2.5 GW in 2023: with a low utilisation rate such as 10%, the manufacturing cost could increase three- to fourfold, to USD 130-260/kW. 
Based on capacity increases envisaged by announced projects, mass manufacturing and economies of scale – in particular to the stack – could lead to 
a decrease in the capital cost of an installed electrolyser system, with costs declining by 40-50% by the end of the decade, and up to 55% if projects at an 
early stage of development are also taken into account. This potential cost reduction is quite close to what is achieved in the NZE Scenario, with capital cost down by 55-60% compared to 2023, and an installed capacity of 560 GW by the end of the decade. In the STEPS, by predominantly taking into account projects that have at least reached FID, the cost reduction is much lower, at around 40% by 2030.
Fossil fuels with CCUS 
About 15 hydrogen facilities around the world are equipped with CCUS, with a cumulative capture capacity of around 12 Mtpa CO2. Most facilities are retrofitted hydrogen production units in refining and fertiliser production in North America, with first operation dating from the early 1980s. Only around 1 Mtpa of the captured CO2 is injected in dedicated storage (at the Quest facility in Canada), and the remainder is injected for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or used in applications such as the food and drink industry, or for boosting yields in greenhouses. Moreover, most facilities have been retrofitted with partial capture, meaning only process emissions – which have a high concentration of CO2 – are captured. This results in only around 0.6 Mtpa H2 production qualifying as low-emissions out of the 0.9-1.2 Mtpa produced43, with 0.35 Mtpa from natural gas reforming (4 Mtpa CO2 captured), and 0.3 Mtpa from coal and oil gasification (8 Mtpa CO2 per year captured).

Only projects with a capture capacity above 100 000 t CO2 per year are considered here. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 79  
Hydrogen is one of the leading applications in CCUS deployment plans. More than one-quarter of CO2 capture capacity under construction or in planning involves hydrogen or ammonia production across a range of applications, including dedicated production, refineries, fertiliser and iron and steel. In the United States, while CO2 demand for EOR was the primary driver for the first plants to capture emissions, the 45Q tax scheme first introduced in 2008 and increased through the IRA in 2022 up to USD 85 per tonne of CO2 stored (around USD 0.8/kg H244), and up to USD 60 per tonne of CO2 used (around USD 0.55/kg H2), along with USD 7 billion in funding for the establishment of clean hydrogen hubs, continues to support development. The United States now accounts for almost half of low-emissions hydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS announced for 2030. 
Air Products recently announced its intention to apply for the 45Q tax credit for the Eastern Louisiana Clean Hydrogen Complex to produce 0.7 Mtpa of hydrogen capturing 5 Mtpa CO2. Projects producing low-emissions hydrogen from fossil fuels can also apply for the 45V tax credit (but not combine both tax credits), which provides an incentive of up to USD 3/kg H2, depending on the CO2 emissions associated with hydrogen production. However, it would be challenging for these projects to reach the maximum reduction of CO2 intensity (0.45 kg CO2/kg H2) stipulated by the scheme, given that upstream emissions for the fossil fuel supply are included in the calculation of the carbon footprint. This would lead to a reduction in support. Moreover, there is still substantial uncertainty around the application of the 45V tax credit, which is delaying multiple investment decisions, affecting not only single projects but also entire hubs.  
In Europe, CCUS-based hydrogen production announcements are concentrated around the North Sea area, which boasts access to both natural gas and CO2 
storage resources. The Netherlands is home to the most advanced CCUS-based hydrogen projects, with three projects that reached FID in 2023, planning to 
connect to large CO2 transport and storage hubs under construction offshore of Norway and the Netherlands. The European Council approved in May 2024 a gas 
and hydrogen markets package, which set a deadline of 1 year from the package being signed into law for the European Commission to publish a Delegated Act 
specifying the methodology for assessing GHG emissions savings from low-carbon fuels (including hydrogen). This is expected to provide further regulatory 
clarity to project developers in the European Union. The United Kingdom currently leads on planned CCUS-based hydrogen production announcements by 2030, 
supported by government-funded industrial decarbonisation programmes, with an FID on the country’s first large-scale project expected this year as part of the Hynet cluster.

Low-emissions hydrogen production is estimated from the plant CO2 capture capacity, and therefore only includes hydrogen production for which CO2 is captured and stored. The range of total hydrogen production is estimated assuming a 40-60% overall unit capture rate for gas-based production and 90-95% for coal and oil-based production, including projects capturing CO2 for utilisation. 
Assuming gas-based production, 0.9105 kg CO2 emitted per normal cubic metre (Nm3) H2 and 90% capture rate. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 80  
In total, Europe could account for around 40% of low-emissions hydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS by 2030.  
In Canada, the sector is benefiting from CCUS investment tax credits and is also likely to benefit from the Clean Hydrogen Investment Tax Credits. The 
development of carbon storage hubs is advancing in the province of Alberta, with one project that reached FID in June 2024. Projects in the Middle East are also progressing. In May 2024, Fertiglobe announced an FID for a 1 Mtpa new ammonia production facility in the United Arab Emirates, with plans to capture and store CO2 from the facility in a second deployment phase that has not yet taken FID.  
If all announced projects are realised, low-emissions hydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS could increase eighteen-fold, from around 0.6 Mt H2 per year in 2023 to 11 Mtpa H2 per year by 2030, or about 8 Mtpa H2 if projects at an early stage of development are excluded (Figure 3.10). The vast majority comes from gas reforming, and less than 1 Mtpa H2 from coal or oil gasification. This is still around 6 Mt H2 short of the circa 17 Mt of low-emissions hydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS needed in 2030 in the NZE Scenario.  
Projects under development are likely to need further policy and financial support to come to fruition. To date, just over 10% of planned production for 2030 is currently at FID or under construction. However, the number of FIDs in hydrogen or ammonia production almost doubled between 2022 and 2023, indicating higher investor confidence in the sector. Hydrogen and ammonia production projects now make up a third of all FIDs taken for CCUS-based projects in 2023.

This could decrease to one-quarter if projects at a very early stage of development (e.g. only a co-operation agreement among stakeholders has been announced) are included.

Low-emissions hydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS could reach close to 11 Mtpa by 2030, 2 Mt of which is in projects which are already operational or have at least taken FID.  
Comparison of different production routes 
Hydrogen production cost 
The steep increase in natural gas prices over 2022 had a big impact on industrial activity, especially in Europe; the cost of producing hydrogen via unabated steam reformers increased by up to two-and-a-half times compared to the previous year. 
This increase was exceptional, and in 2023 natural gas prices fell again – including in Europe, with values around USD 25-70/MWh (based on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility [TTF] exchange). The hydrogen production cost from unabated natural gas was estimated at USD 0.8-5.7/kg H2, similar to the cost prior to the energy crisis. 
Hydrogen produced from unabated natural gas is generally cheaper than electrolytic hydrogen today, but price volatility could remain a challenge. In 
Europe, the ratio between the maximum and minimum gas price (based on the TTF exchange) has been 13 in the last 2 years, and even the United States, which 
has lower gas prices on average, had a price ratio (based on Henry Hub) of more than 10 over the same period.

Notes: CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage; w/ = with; w/o = without. Cost ranges reflect regional differences in fossil fuel prices, renewable costs, CO2 prices, technology CAPEX and OPEX as well as cost of capital. Natural gas price is USD 5-21/MBtu for 2021, USD 6-51/MBtu for 2022, USD 3-35/Mbtu for 2023 and USD 1-15/MBtu for 2030 NZE. Coal price is USD 9-270/t for 2023 and USD 1-120/t for the NZE Scenario in 2030. The levelised production cost of solar PV electricity is USD 20-120/MWh for 2023, USD 14-90/MWh for the NZE Scenario in 2030, with capacity factor of 12-35%. Onshore wind electricity levelised production cost is USD 23-110/MWh for 2023, USD 22-100/MWh for the NZE Scenario in 2030, with a capacity factor of 15-53%. The offshore wind electricity levelised production cost is USD 55-230/MWh for 2023, USD 36-145/MWh for the NZE in 2030, with a capacity factor of 32-67%. Electrolyser CAPEX is USD 950/kW for the NZE Scenario in 2030 and includes the electrolyser system, its balance of plant and EPC, installation cost and contingencies; 
electrolyser capacity factor assumed to be the same as the renewable power plant. The cost of capital is 6-20%. The dashed area represents the CO2 price impact, based on USD 15-140/t CO2 for the NZE Scenario. Renewable-based hydrogen production costs are capped at USD 12/kg H2. Water cost is not included.

Producing hydrogen from unabated natural gas is currently one of the cheapest options, but cost reductions for renewable hydrogen minimise the cost gap by 2030 in the NZE Scenario. 
By 2030, large-scale deployment as in the NZE Scenario could bring down the costs of hydrogen production from electrolysis powered by dedicated renewable 
plants to around USD 2/kg H2 for the main three sources considered in Figure 3.11, i.e. within the range of production costs from fossil fuels equipped with 
CCUS. In China, thanks to very good solar resources in certain locations and a lower electrolyser CAPEX, this could go down to below USD 2/kg H2. In the NZE 
Scenario, CO2 pricing implemented in several countries contributes to increasing the cost of unabated pathways.

Renewable hydrogen production at under USD 2/kg H2 could be realised in certain locations, with a large part of the potential volume by 2030 between USD 2-4/kg H2 in the NZE Scenario. 
By 2030, almost 49 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen could be produced globally based on announced projects. Of this, more than 22 Mt are projects aiming to use solar PV, onshore wind, offshore wind, or a hybrid configuration of these renewables to power the electrolyser. For projects for which a location has been specified, the optimal renewable-to-electrolyser capacity ratio has been computed to identify the potential minimal levelised cost of production. The combination of these results provides insight into the amount of renewable hydrogen that could be produced at low cost by the end of the decade.  

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 84  
The Asia Pacific region could be the cheapest in terms of production cost, with most of the volume coming from hydrogen from solar PV in China: here about 
1 Mtpa H2 could be produced at a cost around or below USD 3/kg H2 in the NZE Scenario. In Europe, electrolytic hydrogen production volume could reach nearly 
9 Mtpa (see Figure 3.12), but the majority of production from dedicated renewable electricity would be realised at a cost above USD 4/kg H2 in both the STEPS and the NZE Scenario. Based on the announced projects, only around 1 Mtpa could be produced at a cost below the unabated natural gas route by 2030 in the NZE Scenario, while more than half of the volume (12 Mtpa) would be at costs up to USD 1.5/kg H2 more expensive than hydrogen from unabated natural gas: without adequate support closing the cost gap, these projects are likely not competitive with the unabated fossil route (Figure 3.12). By considering only projects that are operational or have at least reached FID, only half a Mtpa could actually be competitive against the unabated fossil fuels route by 2030 in the NZE Scenario, and as little as 0.1 Mtpa in the STEPS.

Various regions around the world have excellent renewable resources for low-cost hydrogen production. Production costs could fall below USD 2/kg H2 by 2030 in certain locations. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 85  
Based on the supply cost curve in Figure 3.12, more than half of the production could be between USD 2/kg H2 and USD 4/kg H2 in the NZE Scenario, with 
Australia and Latin America occupying the largest part of this range. However, the LCOH from renewable sources could fall even further and reach values below USD 2/kg H2 in locations with excellent resources, and by considering a hybrid renewable configuration. 
In the NZE Scenario, hydrogen production could reach a levelised cost of around or below USD 2/kg H2 by 2030 in Argentinian and Chilean Patagonia, and in 
certain parts of central China (Figure 3.13). In South America and India, a combination of onshore wind and solar PV is the optimal configuration to reach a 
high capacity factor and keep production costs low (in the south of Argentina, though, the share of solar PV is minimal as wind resources are excellent). 
Production cost from offshore wind at around or below USD 3/kg H2 by 2030 could be achieved in Northern Europe and the southern part of Patagonia, where high capacity factors could be reached.  
The impact of low-emissions hydrogen on the cost of final products
The cost of producing renewable hydrogen today is generally between one and a half and six times higher than unabated fossil-based hydrogen production, 
depending on the location. While this is expected to come down in the medium term, the “green premium” associated with renewable hydrogen is substantial 
today, and can have an impact on the economic competitivity of certain sectors. 
This cost premium is always a key consideration for the industrial sector in the production of materials and feedstocks, such as steel or ammonia, but a closer look downstream at different steps of the supply chain in which these materials are used gives a perspective on how this green premium could be passed to the end user (or final consumer) of different products. Three examples are provided below. 
In the food supply chain, low-emissions hydrogen can be used to produce low-emissions ammonia as a feedstock to produce nitrogen-based fertilisers, such as 
urea. Fertilisers are commonly used in agriculture to increase crop yields, with their cost having an impact on the final cost of agricultural products – and therefore on the cost of food. Starting from a premium of 110-330% for renewable hydrogen today in China and Europe, respectively, the production cost of renewable ammonia could be 40-200% more than for unabated fossil-based production. For this step in the supply chain, it should be noted that in Europe, given high natural gas prices, domestic production of ammonia has reached very high values in recent years, therefore reducing the gap with renewable-based ammonia production. In several cases, this led to a reduction in activity in the European fertiliser industry and a shift towards imports. By taking into account average fertiliser application and yields for wheat production by region, the impact on the production costs for wheat goes down to 2% in China and to 5-10% in Europe and the United States (Figure 3.14).

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 86  
While this may seem very low, the impact on farmers’ finances is not negligible. Moving another step downstream in the supply chain to a commonly used product based on wheat, such as pasta, the premium falls to under 1%. Numerous consumers in advanced economies can (and are willing to) absorb this cost increase, but the situation in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) is completely different. Household budgets are very low in EMDEs and sensitivity to food prices is much higher. Even small increases in prices could put at risk food security. 
Another commonly purchased product that could be affected by the “green premium” of renewable hydrogen is a flight ticket. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), 
which include synthetic kerosene, are needed to decarbonise the aviation sector, but their cost today is 4-10 times higher than fossil kerosene. Producing synthetic kerosene in Europe, with a mix of renewables, has a premium compared to fossil kerosene that ranges from 840% in 2023 to 370% in 2030 and 320% in 2035 on the basis of current policy settings (assuming a moderate cost reduction, in line with the STEPS). By considering the SAF blending shares mandated in REFuelEU Aviation, this translates into an increase in fuel cost of 13% in 2023, 8% in 2030 and 32% in 2035, which considering that fuel price usually represents 25-30% of total flight costs, translates into a ticket price increase in the range of 2% to 8%. 
The increase between years 2030 and 2035 is due mainly to the increase in SAF share to reach 20% SAF in 2035, of which 5% is synthetic kerosene.  
With regards to industrial materials, low-emissions hydrogen is set to play a critical role for decarbonisation in steelmaking. Steel, which is today responsible for about 7% of energy sector CO2 emissions, is used in many different applications, including car manufacturing. Direct reduction of iron ore (DRI) with hydrogen, if powered by clean electricity, could reduce the direct emissions intensity of iron-based steelmaking from more than 2 000 kg CO2 per tonne of crude steel to below 400 kg CO2/kg steel if using 100% iron-based inputs, which would be compatible with the IEA's definition for near zero emission steel. Producing low-emissions steel today in China, Europe or the United States is 27-43% more expensive than producing traditional steel. This premium goes down to only around 1% when passed to the final price of an electric vehicle (EV), by considering an average EV price of USD 27 000 in China and USD 40 000 in Europe and the United States. 
In general, at every additional step downstream in each supply chain, the premium is reduced due to additional cost components and margins of the different 
processes (which have been assumed to be constant, for simplicity). The impact of the premium cost of low-emissions hydrogen on commonly used final products 

The ReFuelEU aviation regulation does not mandate synthetic kerosene use before 2030. For the year 2023, the 2030 mandate has been used for illustrative purposes. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production

therefore falls to just a few percentage points in all the examples analysed, even when starting from today’s high production costs. 
There are some premium markets where consumers could be willing to accept this small green premium, and even more if they have sustainability goals. 
Governments have an opportunity to implement policies that stimulate markets for these end products through public procurement, to reduce emissions in these 
sectors, which can, in turn, generate demand for low-emissions hydrogen. 
However, the consequences of these policies on stakeholders right across the value chains would need to be carefully assessed, with significant implications for policy design.  
Different end users can be expected to respond to these small price increases in different ways. In the case of flights, a small premium can be relatively easily absorbed by clients, in particular those flying in business class, or by large corporations that have already taken action by buying SAF certificates (see Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand). In the case of cars, the willingness to pay the green premium has already been proven in the EV market and is slowly being 
reflected in the growing number of offtake agreements for steel produced with low-emissions hydrogen from carmakers. However, the case of food products is very different: Price increases can be easily absorbed by the wealthiest individuals, but can have a significant impact on the personal budgets of a large share of the population, as has been seen in the recent inflationary period. This impact can be particularly serious in certain countries, particularly Africa, where it could even put at risk food security, due to the limited availability of the majority of the population to absorb price increases. Care should be taken in designing these measures to protect the most price-sensitive products and consumers while still making progress on decarbonising these industries. In addition, there are more factors to weigh in when considering public procurement in this sector. Previous experience shows that policies to incentivise fertiliser adoption have led to imbalanced and inefficient use. In the case of the food value chain, focusing public procurement policies on the end product (e.g. food purchases for schools, food banks or military bases) could help to avoid past policy failures. Procurement practices could also 
be adopted by the private sector, in the same way as for flight tickets. However, this would require the development of reliable systems of certificates and labels to provide certainty to consumers about the low-emission attributes of the end products they are acquiring, which can lead to additional bureaucratic burden.
Finally, farmers and manufacturers further up in the value chain are strongly impacted by cost increases, as their products are globally traded in highly 
competitive markets, where they operate with slim margins. They may be too far removed from the end consumers to be able to benefit from their willingness to pay a premium. Governments designing policies to stimulate these premium markets will need to take a holistic view of the value chain in order to mitigate any risks to stakeholders.

Figure 3.14 Renewable hydrogen cost premium on selected product prices 
Notes: The arrow indicates moving downstream in the supply chain. For the “Food supply chain”, average fertiliser use and yield for each region are assumed; wheat price at USD 270-440/t for 2024; a value of 0.7 kg of wheat per kg of pasta is assumed; ”Import from US to Europe” refers to the case that renewable ammonia produced in Europe is compared against imported ammonia produced in the United States, due to lower natural gas prices in the United States compared to Europe. 
For “Flight ticket in Europe” assumptions are as follows: synthetic kerosene production from a mix of solar PV and onshore wind in Europe, assuming 70% of the CO2 is sourced from direct air capture and the rest from biogenic sources; fuel cost computed with REFuelEU shares of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and e-fuels, assuming the 2030 shares for 2023 for illustrative purposes; fossil kerosene price at USD 25/GJ in 2023, USD 31/GJ in 2030 and in 2035; bio-jet kerosene price at USD 58/GJ; a margin of 10% is added on top of synthetic kerosene production cost; fuel cost assumed to be 25% of the final ticket price in all years. For “EV manufacturing”: steel intensity of 820 kg/vehicle; EV price is USD 27 000/vehicle in China, USD 40 000/vehicle in Europe and United States.

The hydrogen green premium, while substantial today, represents only a few percentage points of increase on the price of final products and is expected to fall further.

The role of water for hydrogen production 
Hydrogen production today uses about 1.5 billion cubic metres (m3) of freshwater, representing less than 5% of the energy sector's total water consumption. 
However, for future development of the hydrogen sector, it will be fundamental to take local water dynamics into account. Hydrogen production pathways differ with regards to water use for feedstock and cooling. The electrolysis process requires about 10 litres of water per kilogramme of hydrogen (l/kg H2) for feedstock and a total 30-70 l/kg H2 for feedstock and cooling, depending on the electrolyser technology and the local climate conditions. Producing hydrogen via steam methane reforming requires a total of 16-40 l/kg H2, with cooling being responsible for the majority of this: water use for feedstock in the steam methane reforming process accounts for about 5 l/kg H2. The water requirement scales notably when the facilities integrate CCUS technologies, and can become even higher than for electrolysis. 
Various water sources could be used, such as groundwater, surface water, wastewater and seawater. Water stress in numerous regions worldwide 
necessitates increased investments in desalination plants for the use of seawater. The global installed capacity of desalination plants stands at approximately 145 million m3 per day, nearly twice what it was in 2010. Desalination plants currently operate in approximately 45 countries worldwide, including China, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and the United States, which together cover more than half of the global installed capacity.  
Box 3.3 
Defining water metrics 
It is essential to distinguish between water “withdrawal” and “consumption” when defining water metrics, as they represent two different aspects of water use. Understanding the difference between these two metrics is crucial for accurate reporting and sustainable water management. 
 Water withdrawal: refers to the total amount of water extracted from a source for use, i.e. surface water (lake, river), groundwater (including rainwater), 
seawater. After use, some or all of this water might be returned to the source (water discharge). 
 Water discharge: refers to the return of water to natural sources after it has been used in various processes. This can include treated wastewater, cooling 
water from industrial processes, or run-off from agricultural fields. 
 Water consumption: represents the portion of the withdrawn water that is not returned back to the initial water source. It is the water that is absorbed, evaporated, or incorporated into products or processes, meaning it is no longer available for reuse in its original form.

Put simply: Water consumption = Water withdrawal – Water discharge. 
Advances and solutions for water supply in hydrogen projects
Water scarcity could pose a challenge to hydrogen projects, especially in renewable-rich but water-stressed areas. Regions that currently do not face water 
stress might also be at risk in future due to increases in droughts caused by climate change. For this reason, it will be important for hydrogen projects to use different water sources and take care of their sustainable management. Based on the announced projects, around 40% of the global low-emissions electrolytic hydrogen production by 2030 is located in water-stressed regions (Figure 3.15).  
Water shortages could mean that hydrogen projects face disruptions or cancellations. Developers in various regions are therefore exploring large-scale 
desalination of seawater, or use of treated wastewater, to ensure an adequate water supply for their projects. For instance, the NEOM project plans to address its water needs through a desalination plant powered entirely by renewable energy, boasting a production capacity of 500 000 m3 of desalinated water per day. This plant will meet 30% of NEOM’s forecasted total water demand, including all the water needs for hydrogen production. Similarly, in South Australia, development agreements have been signed with five companies for hydrogen development, including plans for a large desalination plant with a capacity of 260 000 m3 per day on the Eyre Peninsula, known as the Northern Water project. 
Additionally, desalination plants are also in the pipeline for several other hydrogen projects, indicating a trend towards integrating desalination into various development schemes to ensure water sustainability. Examples include a new hydrogen plant in Peru, aiming to produce 80 kt H2 per year; the project of ACWA Power located in Tunisia; the Nour and Aman projects in Mauritania; a project located in the Port of Pecém (Brazil) and many others in Morocco, Namibia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

Around half of the low-emissions hydrogen production from announced electrolyser projects in 2030 is located in regions facing water stress. 
Desalination equipment will also play a crucial role in offshore electrolytic hydrogen production projects. The world’s first offshore hydrogen production project, SeaLHyfe, with a 1 MW electrolyser developed by LHyfe, started operation in the second half of 2023 after extensive testing. Elsewhere, the pilot project PosHYdon, a 1.25 MW electrolyser situated 13 kilometres (km) off the coast of the Netherlands, is scheduled to start production in the fourth quarter of 2024. Moreover, additional interest in offshore hydrogen developments incorporating desalination plants has been expressed by various companies, such as the consortium of ITM Power, Ørsted, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, and Element Energy in the Ørsted 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production

project; RWE in the H2OpZee floating project in the North Sea and in the AquaVentus project; LHyfe in the HOPE project; and many others.  
Desalination plant costs represent only a minor portion (less than 2%) of overall hydrogen project expenses. The process of reverse osmosis seawater 
desalination requires around 3-6 kWh of electricity per m3 of water, resulting in a cost for hydrogen production of around USD 0.05/kg H2. In certain cases, 
developers could oversize desalination capacity to ensure ample freshwater supply for the project and surrounding areas, benefiting agriculture, industry and domestic users. This approach provides community benefits with limited impact on the economics of the hydrogen production project itself. 
Seawater can be useful in coastal areas facing water scarcity, but seawater cooling and brine discharge from desalination can cause thermal pollution and 
environmental impacts. Thorough assessment and management are needed to minimise these impacts on the ecosystem and ensure that desalination in coastal 
areas is sustainable. The NEOM project will use brine as feedstock for minerals and metals production, aiming for 100% Zero Liquid Discharge in downstream brine industries.  
Around 70% of the low-emissions hydrogen production in 2030 from announced projects using water electrolysis is within 100 km from the coast, so that seawater desalination is a viable option. Also, for projects more distant from the coast seawater desalination can be an option, but they require long-distance pipelines to transport the desalinated water. In water-stressed regions, more than 40% of the low-emissions electrolytic hydrogen production in 2030 is at locations more than 100 km off the coast (Figure 3.16). Experience in long-distance pipeline transport of water exists today, though not in combination with desalination plants. 
The longest freshwater pipeline in operation today transports in Australia water over 560 km from Perth to Kalgoorlie. The costs for long-distance water transport by pipeline depend not only on distance, but also on any elevation that needs to be overcome. Costs can vary from USD 0.15 per m3 and 100 km in flat terrain to USD 1 per m3 and 100 km in terrain with high mountains. Assuming transport costs of USD 0.5 per m3 for a distance of 100 km, this would correspond to USD 0.025/kg H2 (assuming water needs of 50 l/kg H2)

Around 70% of the low-emissions hydrogen production from announced electrolyser projects in 2030 is within 100 km from the coast. In water stressed regions, more than 40% are at locations more than 100 km off the coast. 
Effective thermal management in hydrogen production can reduce water needs and minimise environmental impacts. Efficient hydrogen production technologies 
generate less waste heat, reducing cooling demands and water use – research shows a 1% increase in electrolysis efficiency cuts water intensity by 2%. 
Alternative cooling technologies, such as dry cooling, fogging systems, adiabatic pads systems for Air Fin Coolers, and Tundracel closed-loop cooling tower 
systems, also offer the potential to reduce water requirements compared to traditional wet cooling methods. Researchers at the University of Adelaide and 
Stanford University have made progress on generating clean hydrogen through the electrolysis of untreated seawater, and the sHYp company has already 
patented a membrane-less electrolyser to produce hydrogen from seawater. In addition, Chinese state-owned Dongfang Electric produced hydrogen directly from 
seawater on a floating offshore pilot plant. This technology is still at a very early stage, but could have significant implications, allowing hydrogen producers to bypass potential disruptions to local freshwater supplies by utilising abundant seawater without the need for extensive desalination facilities. 
Several projects for the production of low-emissions hydrogen for steelmaking have been announced, some of them in areas with water stress, such as North 
Africa or Namibia. DRI with hydrogen releases water: for every tonne of iron produced, 0.48 tonnes of by-product water is released. This can be recycled within 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production

the system and used for the hydrogen production process, thereby helping to reduce the demand for large-scale desalination facilities in these regions. The 
potential for water conservation adds another aspect of sustainability to the hydrogen-based DRI process, beyond reducing carbon emissions. 
Countries with water-stressed regions have also introduced legislation that sets conditions for water usage for hydrogen production. For example, Egypt has 
unveiled a bill offering incentives for electrolytic hydrogen production sourced from desalinated water generated using renewable energy. These incentives will be extended to desalination plants and renewable power facilities that allocate at least 95% of their output to hydrogen plants. Brazil has introduced a bill prioritising the use of desalinated water for hydrogen production, as well as rainwater and the non-potable reuse of wastewaters. 
Emerging production routes Natural hydrogen Natural hydrogen can be generated through multiple routes, such as biological reactions, geothermal activity, serpentinisation and radiolysis, among others, and the characteristics of the gas generated, such as its purity, will often depend on the route of generation. Exploration and development of natural hydrogen has been gathering steam during the past years, and in the following section we briefly 
summarise the progress made. Nevertheless, as of August 2024, there are no natural hydrogen wells that have demonstrated commercial feasibility. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production

Geological exploration for natural hydrogen follows similar principles as for hydrocarbons, starting with a technical assessment, which is often the step with the biggest uncertainty. Identification of source rocks, migration pathways, reservoirs and traps are followed by commercial feasibility checks, such as flow-tests, economic viability assessments and obtention of a licence to operate. Given the growing interest in this potential route for producing low-emissions hydrogen, several organisations and research institutions have launched geological surveys to identify the potential hydrogen resources available underground in numerous countries (Table 3.1). 
The world’s only documented hydrogen producer well is in Bourakébougou, Mali, with a production rate of about 1 500 m3 per day, or 0.1 tonnes of hydrogen per day. To put this in context, the US Department of Energy (DoE) Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) targets deposit production (from 
formation) rates of at least 30 000 tonnes of hydrogen per year. This is roughly equivalent to an electrolyser with 170 MW capacity operating for about 5000h/yr, or about 15-30% production of a typical steam methane reformer (SMR) plant.

40 companies were searching for natural hydrogen deposits commercially by the end of 2023, a fourfold increase since 2020. Exploration is underway in Albania, Australia, Canada, Colombia, France, Finland, Korea, Spain and the United States (Table 3.2). Canada-based producer Hydroma claims to be 
extracting natural hydrogen at an estimated cost of USD 0.5/kg H2 in a commercially favourable site in Mali (i.e. very shallow wells [~100 m], nearly pure 
hydrogen). In Spain and Australia, developers report aiming for a cost of about USD 1/kg H2, depending on the deposit's depth and purity. Production tax 
subsidies provided by the US IRA also have the potential to make this production route more economically viable in the United States. Nevertheless, the technical maturity of natural hydrogen is currently estimated to be at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5.  
Several countries have altered their laws and regulations to encourage exploration for natural hydrogen, but it features explicitly in only 3 of the 60 hydrogen strategies published so far. In Europe, an amendment to Poland’s Geological and Mining Law, made in September 2023, provides the legal framework for the exploration and recognition of natural hydrogen fields. In France, natural hydrogen is considered to be an important pillar of the National Hydrogen Strategy, and the country aims to be a pioneer for the production of natural hydrogen. In February 2024, the Philippines opened an auction for the rights to explore for natural hydrogen across two zones around 200 km from the capital city, Manila.  
Australia passed a bill to enable exploration for naturally occurring hydrogen in May 2024.

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 98  
Furthermore, additional legislative support has been offered in South Australia, where one-third of the state is already covered by natural hydrogen 
exploration permits that have either been requested or granted. Elsewhere in the world, though, the legal framework is less clear, and the landscape is evolving fast. 
Other emerging routes 
Hydrogen can be produced from solid biomass through biological, thermochemical or electrochemical conversion. The hydrogen yield is the highest for 
thermochemical processes like gasification, pyrolysis, and reforming, which can produce 40-190 kg H2 per tonne of feedstock, while biological processes like fermentation and anaerobic digestion only achieve around one-quarter of those yields (5-50 kg H2 per tonne of feedstock). The energy efficiency of most of these processes is 40-67% (lower heating value). Thermal and thermochemical conversion, which have the highest TRL, can achieve costs as low as 
USD 1.2-2.4/kg H2, but on average are closer to USD 4.5-7/kg H2. Biological and electrochemical processes have the dual challenge of a low TRL and higher 
production costs, in the range of USD 1.7-4.5/kg H2. Production from biomass can lead to CO2 removal on a lifecycle basis when the CO2 captured during hydrogen production is coupled with underground storage. The choice to produce from biomass will be influenced by the hydrogen application; for example, in the transport sector it might be cheaper to use the biomass (products) directly. 
In China, there were fewer than ten operating gasification plants for hydrogen production in 2023, though several additional plants are under preparation. A 
2.2 ktpa plant in Guangdong province (China) started operating in 2023. This uses steam reforming of biogas from food waste. The estimated investment was 
CHN 92 million (Yuan renminbi) (~USD 13 million). The targeted application is road transport, with Foshan city having almost 1 000 hydrogen buses and over 
500 fuel cell electric vehicles in operation. Another 200 Nm3/hr bioethanol reforming plant in China also started operating in 2023. 
In Europe, the Fuel Cell Tractor Fuelled with Biogenic Hydrogen (FCTRAC) project in Austria aims to demonstrate hydrogen separation from syngas that comes from decentralised wood combined heat and power, biogas and sewage treatment plants for application in fuel cell tractors, and started its demonstration phase in Q3 2023. In the Netherlands, the Fuse Reuse Recycle project is targeting FID in 2024 for a project to convert non-recyclable municipal waste (half of it consisting of biogenic material) to hydrogen. The hydrogen will be used in the nearby Chemelot industrial park. The project had previously received about USD 120 million from the Innovation Fund, out of a total investment of around USD 745 million, and has a capacity of 54 ktpa.

This can vary widely depending on the feedstock and the technology. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 99  
Public support is also being allocated to emerging production routes. Under the second phase of Mission Innovation, Italy approved around USD 39 million for 
biohydrogen (among other technologies), to be spent across 2024-2026. The European Investment Bank will provide free financial advisory to Plagazi (a waste-
to-hydrogen company) for project development in Köping Hydrogen Park (Sweden). This project is sized for 51 MW of hydrogen production, with a total 
investment of about USD 140 million, and aims to start operation in 2025. In the United States, the DoE awarded USD 8.7 million to seven research projects 
covering biomass gasifiers, modular designs, techno-economic analysis, and air separation. The DoE also issued a request for information on industry capability for gasification technologies, industry experience and modelling methods. 
Hydrogen-based fuels and feedstock 
Project developments and outlook to 2030 
Total production of hydrogen-based fuels and feedstocks is expected to grow by almost 15% in 2024, to reach a total of almost 0.5 million tonnes of hydrogen 
equivalent per year (Mtpa H2-eq) (Figure 3.17), on the basis of announced projects that have at least reached FID. This volume represents 70% of the total low-emissions hydrogen production by 2023, but only a small fraction of global annual hydrogen production today of 97 Mt H2. Almost all of the year-on-year growth comes from ammonia production projects. Almost three-quarters of the new ammonia capacity that is expected to be commissioned during 2024 is located in China, 20% in the Middle East, and most of the remainder in Europe. Over half of the capacity located in China comes from just two projects in Inner Mongolia.
Methanation capacity has remained nearly stable, with the biggest project to have advanced beyond demonstration stage being the Great Plain Synfuels plant with a capacity of 125 ktpa H2 – representing 99% of methanation capacity operating today. 
The outlook for hydrogen-based fuels or feedstock based on announced projects adds up to nearly 10 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen production by 2030 
(20 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of development are included). However, only 7% has taken FID, is under construction, or is operational (13% if excluding projects at very early stages of development). Nearly 85% of the project pipeline has ammonia as a targeted product. If all the announced capacity comes to fruition, it would be equivalent to 50% of current global ammonia production. The number of projects targeting the production of synthetic methanol, as a feedstock or fuel, is much lower, equivalent to 5 Mtpa of methanol by 2030, or almost 4% of global methanol production today.

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 100  
All the announced projects for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuel production could produce 1.8 Mtpa H2-eq. by the end of the decade, equal to 1.6% of the aviation sector jet fuel demand in 2023. Smaller still, the full project pipeline for synthetic methane to 2030 would be equivalent to less than 0.02% of global natural gas production in 2023. Projects for hydrogen-based fuels and feedstocks are widely distributed across the world, with North America and 
Australia having 25% each, and Europe and Latin America each with around 11% of 2030 announced output. The project pipeline could meet a significant share of regional hydrogen demand, should all the projects materialise (Figure 3.18).

Source: IEA Hydrogen Production Projects Database (October 2024). 
The project pipeline for hydrogen-based fuels and feedstocks continues to be dominated by ammonia, although over 40% of the volume expected by 2030 is at an early stage of development. 
The country with the largest surplus is Australia, where the project pipeline adds up to nearly ten times the current domestic hydrogen demand. Africa and Latin America have a project pipeline that is comparable to their current hydrogen demand. China, which represents nearly 30% of global hydrogen demand, has 
the smallest project pipeline for hydrogen-based fuels of all regions, with potential to cover just 2% of their current domestic hydrogen demand. However, projects are not announced far in advance in China, and also have shorter lead times than in other regions, so the current snapshot of the pipeline might not be representative of the actual production that could be expected by 2030. In addition, 70% of the output from announced projects in China is for ammonia, while it only represents 1% of current demand.  

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 101  
If projects at early stages of development are not considered, low-emissions production by 2030 drops by 50%. More than 85% of the projects for the 
production of synthetic methanol and FT fuels, in terms of output, are at least undergoing a feasibility study. Australia, India, Indonesia and Mexico are the regions with most projects still at early stages of development. A large share of the low-emissions ammonia is expected to be for export, with ammonia being the most favoured hydrogen carrier for international trade (Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure).

Apart from in China, the project pipeline could cover a significant share of current hydrogen demand for hydrogen derivatives, if all projects come to fruition. 
The cost of producing hydrogen-based fuels and feedstocks
Production cost is one of the key barriers to hydrogen-based fuels deployment. To date, development outside of China has been limited, due to multiple challenges including production cost, lack of CO2 regulation and infrastructure, methodological gaps for measuring and accounting for the GHG mitigation 
benefit of the carbon feedstock (see Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives), and lack of demand incentives. Other than the FuelEU and 
ReFuelEU targets for shipping and aviation in the European Union, there are no other binding policies that would create a significant demand for hydrogen-based fuels.
 
Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 102  
Even these would only equate to 1.1-1.5 Mtpa H2 of demand by 2035.
In 2023, the cost of electrolytic ammonia (NH3) production was nearly triple the average production cost from fossil fuels (Figure 3.19). This is driven by the high investment cost of the assets. This also means that the cost of electrolytic pathways is largely fixed over the asset lifetime, in contrast to the incumbent fossil-based routes where the dominant cost is the fuel subject to price volatility. The electrolyser represents 90% of the total plant CAPEX and it can alone be more than the average fossil-based ammonia price of USD 560/t NH3, with additional operating costs, electricity consumption for compression and synthesis, and profit margins, translating into a price premium. CAPEX is the main cost driver today, with electricity becoming the dominant factor as the technology is deployed. 
Production costs are dependent on deployment rather than a fixed timeline. In the most optimistic scenario, production costs could decrease by 30-50% by 2030 in the NZE Scenario, largely driven by a 60% drop in the CAPEX of the electrolyser, which is, in turn, driven by a cumulative electrolyser capacity of 560 GW and continuous innovation. Other cost reductions come from the massive deployment of solar PV and wind, and from a potential improvement of 3-4 percentage points in electrolyser efficiency. All these factors combined are sufficient to close the cost gap with unabated fossil-based ammonia. At the other extreme, in the STEPS, electrolyser deployment could be an order of magnitude lower, at 50 GW, leading to a cost reduction of about 25-40% by 2030. For ammonia produced from natural gas with CCUS, a gas price of USD 50/MWh (which was close to the average price for Europe in 2023) would lead to a cost contribution of nearly USD 500/t NH3 just from the fuel cost. 
For synthetic kerosene, similar drivers are behind the cost breakdown and expected cost reduction to 2030, but substantial differences result from the CO2 
feedstock cost: there is a wide range of costs from point-source capture, depending on the CO2 concentration in the stream. For concentrated streams, like 
those from ethanol production, ethylene oxide and natural gas processing, the costs are USD 15-35/t CO2, while for more diluted streams, like the flue gas from power generation, the costs can be USD 50-100/t CO2. The upper bound for the CO2 cost is defined by direct air capture (DAC) which can be as wide as USD 100-1 000/t CO2 based on literature and providers’ cost estimates. Using fossil-based CO2 can only lead to certain degree of CO2 reduction, but not to a carbon neutral product, thus only DAC and biogenic CO2 sources are compatible with a net zero emissions scenario (see Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives).
 
1% target for shipping with a 2x multiplier (so half of the energy actually needs to be delivered, and the target is not yet mandatory) until the end of 2033. Range mainly depends on the uptake of energy efficiency rather than fuel mix. Value includes the hydrogen demand for other synthetic products besides kerosene.  
FuelEU Maritime establishes a conditional 2% RFNBO target by 2034 if a 1% RFNBO target is not reached by 2031, which is assumed to be the same by 2035, to be able to combine it with the 2035 ReFuelEU target of 5% of synthetic kerosene. 
This does not consider the emergence of disruptive electrolysis technologies which could offer larger improvements. 
The correlation between natural gas and hydrogen prices could be partially broken by using electricity to achieve the high temperatures in steam reforming and using the natural gas only for the feedstock. 

Chapter 3. Hydrogen production 
PAGE | 103  
By 2030, DAC costs could decrease by 40%, driven by a reduction in CAPEX and lower costs for the energy input. This cost decrease is not certain, 
and will depend on the learning from deployment and material costs. Moreover, it differs significantly depending on the scenario, since DAC deployment is driven by deep decarbonisation. The CO2 feedstock is a key cost driver for synthetic kerosene (Figure 3.19). These two parameters are directly proportional to each other, and for every USD 100/t change in CO2 feedstock costs, the production of synthetic kerosene changes by nearly USD 55/bbl – a value that is equivalent to 70% of the average WTI oil price from the first half of 2024.

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 104  
Highlights 
 Hydrogen trade remains minimal and mainly limited to small-scale, localised transport between neighbouring countries, and trade in hydrogen-based 
products such as ammonia or methanol. In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), interregional trade in hydrogen and hydrogen-based 
fuels reaches more than 70 Mt in hydrogen-equivalent terms (Mt H2-eq) by 2050, representing almost 20% of global low-emissions hydrogen demand in that year.  
 If all announced projects come to fruition, export-oriented projects could account for 16 Mtpa H2-eq, or about one-third of low-emissions hydrogen production by 2030. The amount has increased only marginally since the Global Hydrogen Review 2023, indicating that production projects announced in the past year mainly focus on domestic markets. The announced volume still highlights the potential for an international market, though uncertainties persist. As much as 11 Mtpa H2-eq of this is still at very early stages of development, and a further 5 Mtpa H2-eq is undergoing feasibility study.  
 Ammonia accounts for 85% of the trade from announced projects, reflecting the chemical industry’s existing experience in shipping ammonia. Australia and the United States combined could account for 10 Mtpa H2-eq of exports in 2030, while most projects (75%) target Europe as an import market. 
 Announced new pipeline projects could reach nearly 40 000 km by 2035 – which is almost in line with needs in the NZE Scenario, though only 2% have reached 
final investment decision (FID). Infrastructure development is a capital-intensive, lengthy process, meaning planning must start early. Several pipeline 
projects got underway in the past year, but progress on others is slow.  
 Pipelines are the most cost-effective transport option, particularly for large volumes, but shipping can be cheaper over longer distances. This would require new port infrastructure and suitable tankers. On the basis of announced projects, more than 100 new hydrogen and ammonia terminals and port infrastructure projects could be realised by the end of the decade, on multiple continents. More than half of these projects are new ammonia export terminals. 
 Despite recent project announcements, planned underground hydrogen storage capacities – 10 TWh by 2035 and 40 TWh by 2050 – fall far short of the 
requirements of the NZE Scenario, in which more than 230 TWh is required by 2035. By 2050, the need for hydrogen storage in the NZE Scenario may reach 
410 bcm, a volume comparable to natural gas storage infrastructure today. 

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 105  
Overview 
Today, hydrogen is mostly produced where it is needed, with limited quantities transported over a few hundred kilometres by truck or pipeline. While some pure hydrogen is transported between neighbouring countries via interconnecting pipelines, and there is trade in hydrogen-based products such as ammonia or 
methanol, hydrogen trade remains minimal overall. However, hydrogen trade has the potential to play an important role in the transition to a sustainable, secure and affordable energy system. Countries with ample resources for low-emissions hydrogen production that is more than sufficient to meet domestic needs could benefit economically from exporting hydrogen and products produced from hydrogen, once domestic demand has been met. Countries with limited domestic resources for low-emissions hydrogen production at low costs could import the hydrogen needed to decarbonise their energy systems and reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, and could also improve their energy security by diversifying the mix of supply countries for hydrogen imports. 
The development of hydrogen markets, underpinned by trade, will require infrastructure for transporting and storing hydrogen. For pure hydrogen, this is 
more complex – and therefore more costly – than transporting and storing fossil fuels, given that hydrogen in gaseous form has a lower energy density per volume unit, and a lower liquefaction temperature than natural gas. Compression and liquefaction of hydrogen reduce its volumetric energy density for transport and storage, as does converting hydrogen into carriers such as ammonia or liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) that are subsequently dehydrogenated to supply pure hydrogen. Choosing which option to pursue largely depends on cost considerations, but is also influenced by the extent to which existing infrastructure for handling fossil fuels could be repurposed for hydrogen. 
In addition, or as an alternative to trading hydrogen or hydrogen carriers, countries can economically benefit by producing and exporting higher-value products made with low-emissions hydrogen. These products include ammonia, other nitrogen-based fertilisers, methanol or synthetic fuels for which handling infrastructure and demand already exist.  
Status and outlook of hydrogen trade In the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), interregional trade in hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels reaches more than 70 Mtpa in hydrogen-equivalent terms (Mtpa H2-eq) by 2050, representing almost 20% of global low-emissions hydrogen demand in that year.
 
Interregional trade refers to the transport of hydrogen and hydrogen-derived fuels among regions covered by the Global Energy and Climate Model, but not among countries within the same region.

Hydrogen trade flows are today minimal, and little changed since the publication of the Global Hydrogen Review 2023 (GHR 2023) in September 2023. There are some cross-country hydrogen pipelines connecting industrial areas in Belgium, France and the Netherlands, but these are all relatively small in size and connect users located close to one another. However, there are a few pilot projects aiming to demonstrate the potential for shipping hydrogen, and ammonia and methanol are already traded internationally as feedstocks for the chemical industry. Around 10% of global ammonia demand and 20% of global methanol demand is met through international trade, almost entirely transported by ship. Between 1981 and February 2022, a 2 500 km international ammonia pipeline was in operation between Togliatti in Russia and the port of Odesa in Ukraine, but operations were suspended in June 2023.  
Recent trade projects
International shipping of hydrogen using an LOHC was first demonstrated in 2020 from Brunei Darussalam to Japan using tank containers, and again in 2022 along the same route, but this time in a chemical tanker. A first cargo of liquefied hydrogen (LH2) was shipped in 2022 from Australia to Japan, and two further shipments took place in 2022 and 2024. 
More recently, notable projects include several cargoes of low-emissions ammonia shipped in 2023 and 2024, mainly from the Middle East to Asia and 
Europe (Table 4.1). However, traded volumes are still at a small scale and the definition of low-emissions ammonia varies. The ammonia shipments of the Saudi Arabian fertiliser producers Ma’aden and SABIC Agri-Nutrients were certified by TÜV Rheinland as using “blue” hydrogen54 (138 kt NH3 for Ma’aden and 37.8 kt NH3 for SABIC Agri-Nutrients). An ammonia shipment from the United Arab Emirates to Japan in 2024 was certified as low-carbon by TÜV SÜD. Ammonia 
produced from renewable electricity in Egypt and certified under International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) Plus was shipped to India in 2023. 
A further shipment of ISCC Plus-certified ammonia produced from biomethane and municipal waste took place in 2023 from the Netherlands to Germany. 
In early 2024, DNV certified 614 kt NH3 of Ma’aden’s production as ultra low-carbon ammonia, which requires an 80% reduction of GHG emissions compared 
to unabated fossil production. No details have been announced on potential offtakers for this certified ammonia to date.

Notes: L = litre, NH3 = ammonia; TBC = to be confirmed. This table does not include pre-existing ammonia trade in the fertiliser industry. Around 10% of global ammonia production for the fertiliser industry is traded today, but this is almost entirely based on ammonia production from unabated fossil fuels. Projects characterised as “low-carbon” or “blue” ammonia or hydrogen are included, although information on the emission reduction compared to the unabated production from fossil fuels is not always available. TÜV Rheinland certification requires a CO2 emissions reduction by at least 30% by capturing CO2 and storing it, or chemically or minerally fixing it for at least 25 years. TÜV SÜD certification requires at least a 70% GHG emissions reduction compared to a benchmark intensity of 94 kg CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) per GJ of ammonia. 
The ISCC PLUS certifications for OCI Global and Fertiglobe required GHG emissions being at least 70% and 73%, respectively, lower compared to production with fossil fuels.

Announced trade projects 
Export-oriented projects account for 16 Mtpa H2-eq, or about one-third of the low-emissions hydrogen production that could be achieved by 2030, if all announced projects are realised (Figure 4.1). This highlights the potential for an international market, although uncertainties persist. 
As many as 11 Mtpa H2-eq of the announced export projects by 2030 are still at very early stages of development, and a further 5 Mtpa H2-eq are undergoing 
feasibility study. Of this, less than a third has a potential offtaker among the project partners – an area where lack of progress was already observed in the GHR 2023. 
The share of committed volume, i.e. projects that have at least reached FID or are under construction, is still very low, at less than 3% of the total volume that could be traded by 2030 (or less than 9% if projects at an early stage of development are excluded). As much as 70% of the potential volume to be exported by 2030 not only has not yet reached FID, but also has no potential offtaker among the project partners.

Almost all announced projects for low-emissions hydrogen exports are still at an early stage or undergoing feasibility studies, and ammonia is by far the preferred carrier. 
Potential output from announced export-oriented production in 2030 (if all projects are realised on time) has only marginally increased since GHR 2023, by 
0.1 Mtpa H2-eq (and by 2.3 Mtpa H2-eq for production in 2040). This compares to an increase of 11 Mt H2-eq in low-emissions hydrogen production in 2030 from all announced projects, indicating that domestic use of hydrogen, rather than export, has been the focus of low-emissions production projects announced since September 2023.

Note: “Not defined” refers to projects for which the import destination has not been disclosed. 
Source: IEA analysis based on multiple sources, including company announcements.  
Australia and the United States could become the largest exporters by 2030, and Europe the largest importer, although over half of all production has no defined import destination. 
Ammonia is the most frequently chosen carrier, accounting for 85% of the trade from announced projects. This is due to the already developed international trade market and existing shipping infrastructure for ammonia as feedstock for the chemical industry. In addition, at the import side, ammonia could be directly used in applications such as fertiliser production or potentially as a shipping fuel (see Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation), avoiding the need for reconversion into hydrogen. A preference for ammonia as a near-term trade option is also reflected in the 58 national hydrogen strategies published so far, many of which mention ammonia trade as well as potential demand volumes (see Chapter 6. Policies). Less than 10% of the volume that could be traded by 2030 based on announced projects is using hydrogen in its pure form, whether liquefied or compressed, while around 2% is in the form of synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. 
Synthetic methane, which is produced from hydrogen and CO2 and is compatible with existing natural gas infrastructure and end uses, accounts for around 0.7% of the announced trade projects in 2030. Announced projects to produce synthetic methane in Australia, the United States and Peru for exports to Japan are at early development stages. 
Australia and the United States could become the largest exporters by 2030, together accounting for 10 Mtpa H2-eq by 2030 – more than a third of this volume, however, is from a single project in Kalgoorlie (Australia) for which the exact export location has not yet been defined (Figure 4.2). 

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 110  
Latin America could become the third-largest exporter, with more than 2 Mtpa H2-eq by 2030, although a large part of this has not yet found a delivery destination. Among the projects that have a defined import destination, Europe accounts for 75% of the announced import volume and is expected to become a key market for hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels and feedstocks. Countries in the Asia Pacific region represent another important demand center: based on announced projects, Japan and Korea together could import 3.7 Mtpa H2-eq by 2040. 
Looking ahead to potential exports by 2030, only around 0.5 Mtpa H2-eq is from projects that already have an offtake agreement in place with a buyer. All of these projects are for the delivery of ammonia. It is perhaps little surprise that the two largest traders of this commodity today – Trammo and Yara International – have both signed offtake agreements for low-emissions ammonia from projects under development. Each had a purchased volume of about 4 Mtpa of ammonia in 2022 (including ammonia from unabated fossil fuels), accounting for just under half of all global trade of ammonia, which mainly serves the fertilisers sector. In the case of the NEOM project in Saudi Arabia, Air Products is part of the joint venture behind the project, and is also the sole offtaker. In this case, the target market is different, as the company aims to export ammonia for its subsequent reconversion into hydrogen for use as fuel in the transport sector. Another use of ammonia can be seen in the case of the Donaldsonville (United States) project by CF Industries: 
Japan’s largest power generation company, JERA, plans to import the purchased ammonia to meet demand for low-carbon fuels in Japan (Table 4.2).

Five large projects in Australia, Brazil, Denmark and the United States account for half of all production from 130 announced export-oriented low-emissions hydrogen production projects. 
Overall, around 130 export-oriented projects for low-emissions hydrogen production have been identified, with the project size varying from a few kilotonnes of traded hydrogen to 3.6 Mtpa for the largest project (Figure 4.3). 

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 112  
Five large-scale projects alone account for 8.3 Mtpa, or half of all announced export-oriented production in 2030 (16 Mtpa). None of these projects has reached FID and one is undergoing feasibility studies, while four are at very early development stages. 
Depending on the progress of these large-scale projects, the actual amount of low-emissions hydrogen traded by 2030 could vary significantly. 
Trade contracts and tenders The majority of announced trade projects to date are based on bilateral trade contracts, which can provide investment security to project developers for capital-intensive hydrogen production plants and transport infrastructure by offering clear pricing mechanisms and a sufficient contract duration. Auctions or tenders are often used as competitive instruments to award these contracts. In most cases, auctions are designed so that suppliers bid for the lowest price for which they are willing to sell a certain amount of hydrogen or hydrogen-based fuel (which may be also specified as part of the bid). 
Over the past year, several international auctions or tenders for low-emissions hydrogen have been launched, in many cases initiated by companies planning to use low-emissions hydrogen. In Germany, several steel makers (including Salzgitter AG, Stahl-Holding Saar and thyssenkrupp Steel Europe AG) announced 
tenders for low-emissions hydrogen. Outside the steel sector, Total Energies announced in September 2023 a tender for 500 000 tpa H2 of renewable hydrogen 
for its refineries in Europe (more details on the tenders are available in Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand). 
Auctions initiated by companies suggest that there is a demand for low-emissions hydrogen, which often has been fostered by policy instruments such as incentives or grants. One instrument that combines support for low-emissions hydrogen supply with demand creation is a double auction, in which an intermediary “market-maker” buys low-emissions hydrogen through long-term offtake agreements from suppliers and sells the hydrogen to end users, helping to create a market. As such, the auction covers both buying and selling hydrogen, with the intermediary market-maker covering any losses incurred from the difference between purchase cost and sale price. The H2Global initiative is based on such a double-auction mechanism. The German government was the first supporter of the H2Global approach, committing EUR 900 million to H2Global’s pilot auction, implemented by Hintco, a 100% owned subsidiary of the H2Global Foundation. Hintco enters contracts with sellers and buyers, who often struggle to connect independently at an early stage of market development. This intermediary then buys products – which are typically more expensive than their carbon-intensive counterparts – to sell them through an auction at a lower price to end consumers, thereby supporting growth in demand. First tenders for supply contracts for the imports of renewable ammonia, synthetic methanol and synthetic kerosene were launched at the end of 2022.

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 113  
Tender results for ammonia and synthetic kerosene were announced in July 2024. Fertiglobe, a joint venture of OCI and ADNOC, was awarded the lot for 
ammonia at a delivered price to Europe of EUR 1 000/t NH3 (EUR 811/t NH3 net price excluding delivery). Fertiglobe plans to produce the ammonia in Egypt using hydrogen from the Egypt Green Hydrogen project, with deliveries to Europe starting in 2027 with a potential 19.5 kt NH3 and rising to a total of 397 kt NH3 cumulatively by 2033. The sales auction for renewable ammonia is set to start in 2025-2026. No winners were awarded for the H2Global tender for synthetic kerosene, and the funds will instead be allocated to the tender for synthetic methanol, for which winners have not yet been announced. Moving forward, Germany has allocated an additional EUR 3.83 billion to new tenders of the H2Global programme, including a joint tender by the Netherlands and Germany for hydrogen imports to Europe, with each country contributing EUR 300 million. 
While the first round of H2Global tenders was not dedicated to specific supply regions or countries, future auctions could be geographically targeted. Canada and Germany announced a joint H2Global auction for hydrogen trade from Canada to Germany, with each country committing CAD 300 million (USD 221 million) and the auction to be launched by the end of 2024. Australia and Germany announced a similar H2Global tender, with funds of up to EUR 400 million (USD 443 million).  
Status and outlook of hydrogen infrastructure 
Hydrogen transport infrastructure is essential to connect supply and demand regions, while storage enables efficient management of fluctuations and enhances 
system resilience in the event of supply disruptions. However, the development of infrastructure for hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels faces several challenges: 
 Gas infrastructure projects are large civil engineering projects, often spanning several jurisdictions. As a result, they tend to have long lead times, due in part to lengthy permitting processes and, often, a lack of socio-political support. On average, these projects, including natural gas pipelines, port terminals and underground gas storage facilities, take between 6 and 12 years to complete. 
 The capital costs associated with gas transport and storage infrastructure benefit significantly from economies of scale, particularly in the case of pipelines, which can facilitate the competitively priced transport of large quantities of energy over long distances. For example, a new 20-inch diameter pipeline can transport up to 1.2 GW of hydrogen at a levelised cost of USD 0.6/kg H2/1 000 km. By comparison, a new 48-inch diameter pipeline can transport up to 17 GW of hydrogen at a levelised cost of less than USD 0.2/kg H2/1 000 km. For reference, a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line of 500 kV, which is often used for power transmission over long distances, can transport approximately the same energy as a 20-inch pipeline, though at 2.5 times more cost per GWh for a 1 000 km distance (Figure 4.4).

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 114  
The long lead times associated with gas and power infrastructure mean that it must be planned ahead of the supply and demand projects it will connect, which 
usually have shorter lead times. Failure to do so may prevent these projects from reaching FID. Planning must also incorporate long-term foresight to accurately anticipate infrastructure needs and avoid oversizing facilities that may remain under-utilised, even as projects reach economies of scale. 
Figure 4.4 
Indicative levelised cost of delivering hydrogen, by transport option and distance in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, 2030 Notes: HVDC = high-voltage direct current; H2 = hydrogen; ktpa = kilotonnes per year; LH2 = liquefied hydrogen; LOHC = liquid organic hydrogen carrier (methylcyclohexane considered); USD/kg H2 = USD per kilogramme of hydrogen. Hydrogen pipelines refer to onshore transmission pipelines operating at 25-75% of their design capacity for 5 000 full-load hours. 
Electricity transmission by offshore HVDC indicates electricity transmission required to obtain 1 kg H2 in an electrolyser with 69% efficiency. Transport costs by ship include investment and operational costs to convert hydrogen to a higher-density carrier, store it, ship it and reconvert it to deliver gaseous hydrogen. Shipping capacity range corresponds to the annual capacity of a port terminal with 10 (upper cost range) to 30 (lower cost range) shipments per year. 
Pipelines are the most cost-effective transport option, particularly for large volumes, while shipping becomes more economical over longer distances. 
Transport by pipeline The total length of natural gas transmission pipelines in operation is currently approximately 1 million km. In addition, about 70 000 km are under construction and about 160 000 km are under consideration. As natural gas consumption falls in the transition to net zero emissions, repurposing this infrastructure for hydrogen represents an opportunity to minimise the risk of stranded assets, reduce km H₂ pipelines and power transmission lines H₂ shipping as LH₂, ammonia and LOHC investment costs and potentially shorten lead times, while reducing the environmental impact associated with manufacturing and laying of pipelines.
 
Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 115  
Approximately 5 000 km of hydrogen pipelines are already in operation worldwide, primarily in the United States and Europe. These pipelines are privately owned, relatively small, and connect refineries and chemical complexes, operating under constant loads, all onshore. However, future hydrogen pipelines could be significantly larger, connecting different countries and even continents, including offshore routes. These new pipelines should offer system flexibility, with the capacity to withstand pressure swings from cyclic loading, and provide linepack. 
A hydrogen transmission system of this kind would be quite distinct from current local networks, and would more closely resemble the natural gas transmission in use today, but would be more centralised, and largely rely on trunklines. Even under the NZE Scenario, hydrogen consumption would be lower than current natural gas consumption and concentrated around fewer large users, such as industrial facilities. 
Legal and regulatory frameworks for hydrogen pipelines
Policy makers are already working on legal and regulatory adjustments needed to enable the deployment of dedicated hydrogen infrastructure. In May 2024, the 
European Council adopted the “Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Markets Decarbonisation Package” to reform the existing EU regulatory framework for low-
emissions gases (see Chapter 6. Policies). The package covers transmission, storage and distribution, introducing unbundling56 and a regulated third-party 
access regime by January 2033. Hydrogen pipelines will be regulated according to the European Union’s standard Regulated Asset Base model, allowing 
operators to obtain a guaranteed return on investment, in exchange for allowing third-party access to their infrastructure. 
The new regulation also initiated the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen (ENNOH), which consists of certified hydrogen transmission network 
operators in EU member states. In June 2024, future EU hydrogen transmission network operators agreed on draft rules for the establishment of ENNOH, including statutes, rules of procedure and a list of members. These draft rules will be reviewed by the European Commission and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, with ENNOH expected to be established in the second quarter of 2025. The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas and ENNOH will jointly develop a 10-year hydrogen network development plan, to be published in 2026.
  
Linepack refers to the volume of gas stored in a pipeline. The gas can be compressed, increasing the pressure of the pipeline. Since the pipeline can operate within a safe pressure range, the amount of gas injected into a pipeline may differ from the amount of gas withdrawn at a specific time, providing short-term operational flexibility to match supply and demand. 
Unbundling refers to the separation of activities potentially subject to competition, such as hydrogen production, from those where competition is not possible or allowed, e.g. transmission and distribution, which is a regulated monopoly in the European Union. This would allow the independent transmission system operator model under certain conditions. 

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 116  
This will serve as the basis for selecting “Projects of Common Interest”, and from 2028 onwards, ENNOH will be solely responsible for the network’s development. 
Member states have started to designate their hydrogen network operators to be part of ENNOH and participate in planning the European hydrogen network. In 
December 2023, Spain appointed Enagás as the provisional operator of the hydrogen transmission network. In April 2024, Belgium appointed Fluxys as 
Hydrogen Network Operator for the future transmission grid, in accordance with the Belgian Law on the Transmission of Hydrogen by Pipelines of July 2023. In 
June 2024, the Netherlands appointed Gasunie as the intended network operator for the future North Sea hydrogen network. Outside the European Union, other 
countries are also taking steps to develop the required regulatory frameworks. In April 2024, Israel granted Natgaz permission to build and operate hydrogen and CO2 pipelines. 
In June 2024, the EU Commission approved a EUR 3 billion German state aid scheme to support the development of a hydrogen core network. The aid, in the 
form of a state guarantee from the state-owned development bank KfW, will enable transmission system operators (TSOs) to secure favourable loans. 
Germany's hydrogen network is expected to be completed by 2032, with the possible extension of some projects until 2037, and will cover 9 700 km, 60% of 
which would be repurposed natural gas pipelines, at a cost of around EUR 20 billion. The network will be funded by user charges and private sector 
investment, with interim government funding to cover initial shortfalls, through top-up funding dubbed “WANDA”. Initially, the network fee will be set at a rate lower than would be needed to cover costs, to prevent very high fees from low utilisation rates. The Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) will review the fees every 3 years, with the aim of recovering the investment made by 2055. In April 2024, BNetzA launched a consultation on determination of the WANDA, and this was confirmed in June 2024, with the aim of setting uniform tariffs from January 2025 and keeping them as stable as possible until 2055. Furthermore, the government will implement an amortisation system, which will guarantee a 6.7% pre-tax return on equity, with operators covering 24% of the costs if the ramp-up of the network fails. In May 2024, Germany passed the Hydrogen Acceleration Act, which, among other things, gives hydrogen infrastructure the status of “overriding public interest” and simplifies approval procedures.  
In April 2024, the Danish government agreed to provide financial backing for the construction of a hydrogen pipeline network, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. These include securing a committed booking capacity of 1.4 GW (approximately 44% of the pipeline’s total capacity), with the possibility of lower tariffs being charged by the Danish gas TSO, Energinet, during the start-up period, with the provision to recover the shortfall once more users are connected.

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure

The Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office of the US Department of Energy (DoE) aims to develop more efficient guidelines for permitting hydrogen pipelines and large-scale projects by 2025, with stakeholder engagement, as outlined in its Multi-Year Program Plan. This goal is also a near-term milestone in the US National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap. 
Project announcements for dedicated pipelines
A number of project announcements and updates on hydrogen transmission pipelines across and between countries have been made during the past year  
Figure 4.5 
Global hydrogen transmission pipeline length in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario and announced projects, 2035-2040 
Note: NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.  
The length of hydrogen pipelines announced for the next decade is almost in line with the needs of the NZE Scenario, but only 2% of projects have reached FID. Although the total length of announced new pipeline projects could reach almost 40 000 km by 2035 – which is almost in line with the needs of the NZE 
Scenario (Figure 4.5) – the total length of projects that have reached FID remains minimal at only 2%. Since the publication of GHR 2023, construction 
of the first 30 km of the Dutch hydrogen backbone started in October 2023 (Table 4.3), and the cross-border MosaHYc project between France and 

A detailed list of announced projects for the construction of new hydrogen pipelines or the repurposing of natural gas pipelines for hydrogen can be found in the IEA Hydrogen Infrastructure Database (October 2024). 

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 118  
Germany reached FID in April 2024. In addition, construction of a 700 km hydrogen pipeline in China is due to start in mid-2024. 
In spite of these announcements, uncertainties in production and demand, coupled with a still-limited regulatory framework, could mean that there is not yet 
sufficient financial and legal certainty for potential investors in low-emissions hydrogen infrastructure. This is already impacting plans for the development of infrastructure projects. The target year for the completion of Germany's planned hydrogen pipeline network is 2032, but in April 2024 an extension of 5 years was announced, pushing the completion date to 2037, so as to facilitate financing and allow more time for certain projects to become operational. Similarly, in June 2024, the completion of the Delta Rhine Corridor between the Netherlands and Germany was delayed by 4 years, from 2028 to 2032. Simultaneous construction of pipelines for hydrogen, CO2 and ammonia has proved challenging due to different requirements, and separate timelines for each pipeline will now be considered.  
Delays in the deployment of hydrogen infrastructure have a knock-on effect on the speed at which low-emissions hydrogen production and demand can scale up. 
Without the necessary infrastructure, the link between production and demand cannot be made. For the developers of projects to produce low-emissions 
hydrogen, this increases the risk of being unable to secure offtakers, since they have no visibility on when they could be able to deliver their product to consumers. 
Similarly, a lack of certainty on infrastructure also puts at risk the plans of potential consumers of low-emissions hydrogen (which are often developed as a response to new regulatory requirements), since they cannot be sure of securing supply. 
Although the deployment of hydrogen pipelines has been sluggish, gas TSOs have issued several calls to confirm interest in hydrogen transmission infrastructure since mid-2023 (Table 4.3). Calls typically start with a non-binding phase to assess market needs and conduct feasibility studies. If this initial phase is successful, it is followed by a binding phase, in which transmission capacity is contracted and investment decisions are made. In December 2023, the first capacity contract was signed for the transport of low-emissions hydrogen through a repurposed ONTRAS pipeline. This contract secures transport capacity for producers to deliver hydrogen to the TotalEnergies refinery in Leuna, Germany, by 2025. In addition, since the GHR 2023, several non-binding calls of interest have been launched in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. For cross-border hydrogen transmission networks, high-level announcements and commitments from gas TSOs and/or governments in the jurisdictions concerned are crucial to enabling the development of networks and related infrastructure.

The European Hydrogen Backbone initiative involves 33 gas infrastructure operators from 25 EU member states, as well as Norway, Switzerland and the 
United Kingdom. The latest roadmap for this initiative envisions a 31 000 km pan-European hydrogen pipeline network by 2030, based on repurposed natural gas 
pipelines wherever possible. There are additional co-ordination activities between European gas TSOs to co-operate on the development of joint cross-infrastructure hydrogen pipelines. In June 2024, nine European gas TSOs signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to co-ordinate and facilitate hydrogen infrastructure in the Baltic Sea region. This is intended to contribute to the Marienborg Declaration of August 2022, which commits to strengthen energy security in the region by exploring joint cross-border renewable energy projects and identifying infrastructure needs. 
Some of the projects resulting from these co-operation initiatives are already moving forward. In April 2024, the European Commission published the first list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI) and Projects of Mutual Interest (PMI). Of the 166 selected projects, 31 relate to the development of onshore and offshore hydrogen pipelines, including between member countries (in the framework of PCIs), as well as PMIs with non-member countries. These projects will benefit from streamlined permitting, regulatory support and possible EU financing from the Connecting Europe Facility. The process for establishing the second EU list of PCIs and PMIs will start in the third quarter of 2024. 
In February 2024, the European Commission approved the third round of Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) for hydrogen infrastructure under EU state aid rules. A total 33 projects in seven member states – France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia – were 
approved, committing up to EUR 6.9 billion in public funding, with the expectation of unlocking a further EUR 5.4 billion in private investment. IPCEI Hy2Infra aims to deploy approximately 2 700 km of new and repurposed hydrogen transmission and distribution pipelines for operation by 2027-2029. 
While there are still no offshore hydrogen pipelines, offshore projects are also advancing. In April 2024, Gassco (Norway) and GASCADE (Germany) signed an 
MoU to transport hydrogen by pipeline from Norway to Germany by 2030, a project with PMI status. Gassco would develop the Norwegian export infrastructure, while GASCADE would develop “AquaDuctus”, an offshore hydrogen pipeline in the North Sea to connect to Germany. In June 2024, Enagás (Spain), GRTgaz and 
Teréga (France), in co-operation with OGE (Germany), signed a joint development agreement for the BarMar hydrogen infrastructure, which holds PCI status. This agreement outlines conditions for feasibility studies, and preliminary conditions for an FID, with Enagás contributing 50%, GRTgaz 33.3%, and Teréga 16.7%. In April 2024, Germany and the United Kingdom announced a joint feasibility study on hydrogen trade (including via offshore pipeline), with results expected by the end of the year. 

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 121  
Announcements have also been made outside Europe for both onshore and offshore hydrogen pipelines. In September 2023, Morocco announced plans to build a 5 600 km hydrogen pipeline from Nigeria through 11 West African states, mostly offshore, in parallel with a planned natural gas pipeline for which feasibility 
studies are underway. In the same month, Oman announced plans for a 2 000 km hydrogen pipeline network, which may extend to other countries such as the 
United Arab Emirates. A few months later, it was reported that Hydrogen Oman (Hydrom) was establishing an infrastructure company for the hydrogen sector, 
with OQGN, the owner and operator of Oman's natural gas transmission network, as one of the stakeholders. In October 2023, Singapore’s Sembcorp Utilities and Indonesian state-owned utility company PLN signed a joint development study agreement to explore the feasibility of an offshore hydrogen pipeline from 
Indonesia to Singapore. In the same month, Singapore’s City Energy announced that they would conduct a feasibility study for the transport of hydrogen by pipeline from Johor, Malaysia, to the Senoko gas plants in Singapore. However, in April 2024, the Singaporean government highlighted that despite the ongoing studies, there were no immediate plans to construct hydrogen transmission pipelines in the country. In February 2024, Germany and Algeria set up a hydrogen taskforce to assess the potential for production, storage and transport of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels, including by offshore pipeline as part of the Southern Hydrogen Corridor, connecting North Africa and Europe. In June 2024, Korea announced a USD 577 million plan for a hydrogen belt along its east coast, with the President emphasising the necessity of constructing a hydrogen pipeline network. Namibia and South Africa are also exploring the possibility of a hydrogen pipeline to connect the two countries. 
Technical advances in hydrogen pipelines  
Hydrogen pipelines already exist today, but there are several technical issues that will need to be addressed for the hydrogen pipelines of the future, which could connect regions, countries and even continents. 
Onshore hydrogen pipeline standards. The American standard ASME B31.12, launched in 2008, is currently the only standard providing specific requirements 
for onshore hydrogen pipelines. However, it is now due to be retired, as it was originally designed for smaller pipelines over relatively short distances, and is considered impractical and overly conservative for hydrogen transmission pipelines. Instead, relevant requirements will be integrated into the 2026 edition of the widely used ASME B31.3 (process piping) and ASME B31.8 (gas transmission and distribution) standards. This will streamline regulatory compliance for hydrogen pipelines, enhancing consistency across hydrogen and gas pipeline standards. 

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 122  
Offshore hydrogen pipelines. There is currently no practical experience with offshore hydrogen pipelines. Nevertheless, ongoing initiatives, such as the 
DNV H2Pipe joint industry project, are working to develop standards for new and repurposed offshore pipelines for hydrogen transmission, focusing on structural integrity, material challenges and safety. In August 2024, a protocol to assess the performance of metals and welds used in subsea pipelines exposed to hydrogen developed by Saipem (an Italian energy and engineering construction company) received two certifications (Approval in Principle and Technology Qualification) from RINA (a multinational consultancy specialised in inspection, certification and engineering). In addition to these standards, several announced projects have commenced feasibility studies involving offshore hydrogen pipelines. In February 2024, Wood and Tecnoambiente were contracted to undertake preliminary assessments and environmental evaluations of the BarMar pipeline between Barcelona and Marseille in the Mediterranean Sea. In April 2024, Mott MacDonald was awarded a contract by Gasunie to assess the feasibility of offshore hydrogen transport infrastructure, with Gasunie also assessing the potential of repurposing offshore gas pipelines for hydrogen transport. Detecting hydrogen leaks. Regulations must encompass detection, monitoring and mitigation strategies for hydrogen leakage, especially in transport and storage. However, due to regulatory gaps, hydrogen leakage detection 
technologies are currently limited, and primarily focus on identifying large, potentially explosive leaks, lacking the speed and sensitivity needed for smaller leaks. Although there is no commercially available high-sensitivity technology today, several projects have demonstrated the use of advanced sensors with parts-per-billion (ppb) sensitivity. In April 2024, the US DoE announced up to USD 20 million in funding for the H2SENSE exploratory topic, an initiative managed by ARPA-E that aims to develop low-cost, high-accuracy hydrogen detection and quantification technologies. In addition, the NHyRA (pre-Normative research on Hydrogen Releases Assessment) project, funded by the European Commission and the Clean Hydrogen Partnership, was launched in April 2024. The aim is to develop methodologies to measure and quantify hydrogen releases throughout the value chain, and propose solutions to mitigate them. 
Non-metallic composite pipelines. Non-metallic composite pipelines are being explored for their lightweight, ductile, spoolable, and corrosion-resistant properties, which make them easier to transport and lay. Given that they have higher investment costs than steel pipelines, these composite pipes may be most suitable for shorter distances. In February 2024, Strohm completed a hydrogen permeation assessment using a thermoplastic composite pipe, demonstrating an almost tenfold reduction in hydrogen permeation compared to a steel pipeline. In May 2024, China’s first non-metallic hydrogen composite pipeline began operating, and can transport both natural gas and pure hydrogen at 42 bar. For offshore applications, the HOPE project is aiming to use a thermoplastic pipeline to transport hydrogen ashore over a kilometre distance to the port of Ostend, Belgium, by 2026.

Hydrogen blending 
Hydrogen blending is seen as an interim solution for the period until more efficient uses of hydrogen are available, or as a derisking option for large production projects while demand becomes available and the required infrastructure to deliver hydrogen to end users is deployed. However, blending projects face concerns about their efficiency and how the associated cost can impact final individual consumers, as well as local opposition due to safety fears. In spite of these setbacks, a meaningful number of projects are now under development, backed by supportive policy decisions. For example, in December 2023, the UK government announced the decision to support blending of up to 20% hydrogen by volume into gas distribution networks in Britain. 
Blends of natural gas and hydrogen are already being used in several town gas networks in Singapore, Hong Kong and Hawaii, with plans to eventually replace 
fossil-based hydrogen with low-emissions hydrogen. For example, in May 2024, Hawai’i Gas announced a partnership with Euros Energy America to increase the 
hydrogen content of its gas mix from 15% today to 20% (in volumetric terms), using renewable hydrogen. Moreover, in recent years, gas operators have been 
assessing the feasibility of blending hydrogen into their natural gas networks and any adaptations required. In March 2024, DNV announced that it is developing feasibility studies for Enbridge (transmission) and Fortis (distribution) to determine the percentage of hydrogen that can be safely transported through their existing natural gas infrastructure in British Columbia (Canada). In April 2024, Stuttgart-based gas distributor Netze announced that its distribution network would be able to operate with blends of up to 30% hydrogen, with minor adjustments, following the completion of the Hydrogen Island Öhringen project. In November 2023, the Spanish gas association Sedigas and BIP Consulting released the CavendisH2 study, a theoretical research assessment of the retrofitting requirements for different hydrogen blends in the existing gas distribution infrastructure.  
Since the GHR 2023just a few hydrogen blending projects have entered operation. 
Dominion Energy Ohio launched a 5% hydrogen blending pilot in a closed loop system at its training centre. In September 2024, the Green Hysland project 
injected hydrogen from the 2.5 MW plant into Mallorca's 1,400 km natural gas grid. 
There are some new announcements that may involve larger-scale hydrogen blending at the distribution and/or transmission level in the coming years. In 
  
If not stated otherwise, hydrogen shares are on a volumetric basis. 
A list of hydrogen blending projects and their status can be accessed through the IEA Hydrogen Infrastructure Database (October 2024).

PAGE | 124  
January 2024, German gas TSO GASCADE confirmed the grid connection of H2E’s hydrogen production site in Lubmin to the EUGAL gas transmission pipelines. This connection will enable hydrogen blending once the plant becomes operational, by the end of 2025, until the dedicated hydrogen pipeline from the \"Flow - making hydrogen happen\" project enters service. In May 2024, the Portuguese government launched its ﬁrst tender for renewable hydrogen and biomethane to be blended into the national gas network. The tender sets a price cap of EUR 127/MWh H2, with a procurement target of 3.0 ktpa H2, divided equally, with half designated for injection into the transmission grid and the other half into the distribution grid. 
Deblending technology, which enables the separation of hydrogen from natural gas being transported in hydrogen networks, is still not widely available at a large-scale. In January 2022, Linde inaugurated the world's first full-scale demonstration plant in Dormagen, Germany, which uses membrane separation followed by pressure swing adsorption to produce high-purity hydrogen. In May 2023, Towngas in Hong Kong announced the successful extraction of hydrogen from their town gas stream using pressure swing adsorption technology, achieving a purity of 99.99%. Elsewhere, in December 2023, DNV announced its support for UK National Gas Transmission (NGT) in the FutureGrid Phase 2 project. This project aims to develop a hydrogen deblending, purification and refuelling facility at the Spadeadam test site. 
Underground hydrogen storage 
The global underground storage capacity for natural gas is approximately 490 billion cubic metres (bcm), which represents around 12% of annual gas 
demand. In Europe, capacity can account for as much as one-third of demand to accommodate seasonal spikes in demand for heating. Approximately 80% of this 
storage is in porous reservoirs, primarily depleted gas fields. In a global shift towards low-emissions hydrogen, storage requirements would need to follow 
accordingly. While demand for hydrogen is expected to be less seasonal than demand for natural gas, it will be essential for countries to determine appropriate storage levels to ensure energy security, particularly for those dependent on imports. 
Hydrogen storage can also be used to provide seasonal flexibility to electricity systems with high shares of variable renewables or strong seasonal variations in electricity demand. Hydrogen storage facilities can handle multiple cycles per year to accommodate such intra-seasonal variations. Where geologically available, salt caverns are a suitable storage option. Despite their higher cost per unit of capacity, 
salt caverns offer a favourable option for managing variability, and lined hard rock caverns (which can be found in more places), may do the same, although this is still at demonstration phase. Despite being more widely available, porous reservoirs such as depleted gas fields and saline aquifers have yet to be fully tested for their flexibility to ramp up quickly, and to assess any issues related to hydrogen losses during storage.

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 125  As such, while the technology for pure hydrogen storage in porous reservoirs has yet to be fully demonstrated, they could potentially play an important future role in improving energy security due to their larger size and lower investment cost per storage capacity. 
New salt cavern facilities for hydrogen storage have been announced, and several have progressed towards more advanced planning stages. In November 2023, 
Vortex started drilling at the site of two salt structures potentially suitable for hydrogen storage in Canada. In December 2023, the H2CAST Etzel project 
completed the conversion of two large existing salt caverns previously used for natural gas storage into hydrogen storage, with leak tests (using nitrogen) 
successfully completed during the first half of 2024. During the second half of 2024 the facility will run leak tests with hydrogen. In August 2024, Uniper inaugurated a hydrogen storage pilot at a salt cavern site in northern Germany. The pilot project can store 3 000 m3 and – if tests are successful – Uniper announced plans to invest up to EUR 500 million to expand the facility to commercial scale (with a storage capacity of 250 GWh of H2), subject to the availability of public support. In January 2024, it was announced that China had started the construction of its first project for underground hydrogen storage of hydrogen in caverns, in the abandoned mines of the city of Daye, which will be dedicated to research activities. 
In the European Union, seven underground hydrogen storage projects were included in the first list of PCI and PMI published in April 2024. In addition, the EU IPCEI Hy2Infra covers the development of large-scale hydrogen storage facilities with capacity of at least 370 GWh.  
Nevertheless, despite this progress, as of today there are only three projects for underground hydrogen storage worldwide that have at least reached FID – two of them since the launch of the GHR 2023. In addition, some storage s
ystem operators in the European Union have already launched calls for interest (Table 4.4). All EU operators will have to carry out these market assessments every 2 years, according to the EU Regulation on the internal market for renewable gas, natural gas and hydrogen adopted by the European Parliament in April 2024. 
 
A comprehensive list of project announcements related to the construction of new underground hydrogen storage facilities or the repurposing of existing natural gas storage facilities for hydrogen can be found in the IEA Hydrogen Infrastructure Database (October 2024)

In early 2024, Uniper conducted a non-binding call for interest to assess demand for 250-600 GWh of hydrogen storage capacity in salt caverns, starting with the Krummhörn site. 
The results confirmed a strong interest in capacity by 2029, with notable demand for greater flexibility, i.e. significantly higher injection and withdrawal rates compared to natural gas. 

Germany 
April – May 2024 
INES, the association of German operators of gas and hydrogen storage systems, has launched a market survey on the future demand for hydrogen storage. 
Salt caverns. Salt caverns have been used for hydrogen storage since 1972 in Teesside (United Kingdom) and since 1983 on the Gulf Coast of Texas (United States), mainly for chemical and petrochemical processes, with a total capacity of 500 GWh. Although the technology is already available, further 
research is being carried out to test cyclic loading and unloading and the possibility of repurposing salt caverns previously used to store natural gas for hydrogen. In March 2024, the FrHyGe project, supported by the European Union, was launched to demonstrate the feasibility of repurposing natural gas salt caverns for hydrogen storage in France and Germany, with high cycle injection and withdrawals. In June 2024, 350 kg H2 were injected into the Géométhane salt caverns in Manosque, France, to study the behaviour of hydrogen and to prepare for full-scale deployment in the GeoH2 (France, 6 000 t H2) and SaltHy (Germany, 5 200 t H2) projects by 2030.  
Lined hard rock caverns. In 2022, the HYBRIT project in Luleå, Sweden, launched the first 100 m³ pilot plant for hydrogen storage in lined hard rock 
caverns, with testing continuing through 2024. The results show that the integration of storage can reduce the costs of a constant supply of hydrogen by 
25-40%. In March 2024, the UK NGT secured public funding to assess the potential of Gravitricity's lined hard rock cavern technology, known as H2FlexiStore, which has a capacity of 100 t H2.

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 127  
This evaluation could pave the way for a demonstration project in 2025. 
Porous reservoirs. Depleted gas fields and saline aquifers have not been proven for storage of pure hydrogen. Storage of town gas containing up to 50-60% of hydrogen, was commercially deployed at several porous reservoirs from the 1950s until the 1980s, but there were instances of hydrogen loss due to microbial activities, such as methanation and sulphate reduction, which react with hydrogen and reduce its content. The extent to which these issues could arise with pure hydrogen storage remains unclear. While research has been carried out to understand the behaviour of hydrogen stored in porous reservoirs, these studies have been small-scale and often involved hydrogen mixtures rather than pure hydrogen. In November 2023, the Underground Sun Storage 2030 project in Austria, led by RAG Austria, announced that it had started injecting hydrogen in a porous reservoir, and in June 2024 announced that it had started its first withdrawal phase. In March 2024, Uniper's HyStorage project in Germany presented preliminary results after injecting a 5% hydrogen blend into a depleted gas porous reservoir. Almost 90% of the hydrogen was successfully recovered and microbial activities were observed on a small scale. Large-scale projects are planned for the end of the decade. In January 2024, the EUH2STARTS project, also led by RAG Austria and supported by the European Union, was launched to demonstrate large-scale underground hydrogen storage in depleted porous natural gas reservoirs. In June 2024, Centrica Energy Storage awarded a front-end engineering design (FEED) contract to Wood to prepare the Rough natural gas storage facility in the United Kingdom, a depleted gas field, for future repurposing for hydrogen storage. The FEED is expected to be completed by early 2025. With regards to hydrogen storage in saline aquifers, Fluxys launched the BE-HyStore project in October 2023 to explore the possibilities of hydrogen storage in Loenhout, Belgium, which has a potential storage capacity of 2.4 TWh H2.  
 
Depending on the processes used to obtain town gas, it is a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and other volatile hydrocarbons.

Figure 4.6 
Global underground geological storage capacity for hydrogen in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario and announced projects, 2035-2050 
Note: NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. 
The long lead times associated with underground hydrogen storage projects mean that accelerated action is urgently required to get on track with the NZE Scenario. 
Despite recent project announcements, the expected underground hydrogen storage capacities – 10 TWh by 2035 and 40 TWh by 2050 – are well below the 
requirements of the NZE Scenario (Figure 4.6). Due to its low density, hydrogen requires three to five times the volume needed for natural gas to store an 
equivalent amount of energy at the same pressure. In the NZE Scenario, more than 230 TWh (85 bcm under normal conditions, 0.5 bcm at 200 bar) of 
underground hydrogen storage would be required by 2035, compared to the current 4 800 TWh (490 bcm under normal conditions, 2.2 bcm at 200 bar) of 
natural gas storage. By 2050, the need for hydrogen storage in the NZE Scenario may reach a volume comparable to the extensive natural gas storage 
infrastructure developed over the last 50 years. The current gap between announced underground storage projects and NZE Scenario needs is significantly 
larger than for production projects, demand creation or pipelines. For hydrogen to play its role in the transition to a net zero energy system, the scale-up of production and use will need to be accompanied by the development of the required infrastructure, including large-scale storage capacities that can help to deal with seasonality and potential supply disruptions. Failure to have this critical infrastructure available at the time when large production projects are expected to start operating, or when large industries are aiming to switch to low-emissions hydrogen, can jeopardise these projects and, therefore, the required scale-up of hydrogen uptake (and its subsequent contribution to climate goals). There is an urgent need for government, TSOs and industry to work together to find ways to speed the development of storage projects, which have longer lead times than production and demand projects.

Infrastructure for transport by ship For transporting hydrogen over very long distances there are options that can be less expensive than pipelines (Figure 4.4). Given the complexities involved in achieving significant economies of scale, particularly at the initial stages, and in crossing multiple jurisdictions, shipping hydrogen can be an attractive alternative. If pure hydrogen is required at the destination, it can be shipped as liquefied 
hydrogen or as ammonia – which needs to be cracked back into hydrogen and nitrogen – or using a LOHC (which should then be dehydrogenated to supply pure 
hydrogen). If pure hydrogen is not required, hydrogen can be transported more easily as ammonia, methanol, synthetic fuels, or even in bulk as products 
manufactured with low-emissions hydrogen, such as hot briquetted iron (see Chapter 8. Latin America in focus). 
Transporting hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels requires the use of specialised port infrastructure. This includes deep-water facilities for the handling of liquefied gases such as hydrogen and ammonia, as well as conversion plants for the transformation of hydrogen into hydrogen carriers at the exporting port. 
Additionally, reconversion facilities may be necessary at the importing port for the processing of these carriers back into pure hydrogen. 
Infrastructure at ports Current energy trade by ship relies on infrastructure designed to store coal, oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in ports. For natural gas, this infrastructure also includes liquefaction facilities at export terminals and regasification facilities at import terminals. In addition, ammonia and methanol are traded globally, albeit as chemical feedstocks. The export infrastructure for natural gas, ammonia and methanol (which are mainly produced by steam reforming of natural gas) is located in regions with abundant natural gas resources. In contrast, the import infrastructure for these energy and chemical commodities is more widespread, reflecting the larger number of importing countries compared to exporting countries. 
 
Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure

Figure 4.7 
Existing and announced port infrastructure projects for hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels trade and bunkering 
Port facilities for the trade and bunkering of ammonia and methanol are planned around the world, which will significantly expand current capacity at terminals. The current global anhydrous ammonia trade is approximately 20 Mtpa, which is equivalent to around 3.5 Mtpa of hydrogen and represents approximately 10% of global ammonia production. However, as well as anhydrous ammonia trade, the majority of ammonia-derived trade is currently in the form of urea (16% of global ammonia production) and other nitrogen-based fertilisers, which are solids that can be transported in bulk. In contrast, ammonia is a gas at ambient conditions and must be liquefied, in addition to requiring specific safety considerations.  
There are currently 150 terminals and ports capable of handling ammonia (Figure 4.7), but this infrastructure is relatively limited in comparison to the announced projects for trading 13 Mt of hydrogen as ammonia by 2030, which is equivalent to around 70 Mt of ammonia (Figure 4.1). To meet this demand, there is a need for a significant expansion of ammonia trade infrastructure, effectively tripling the current capacity within this decade. This could lead to a significant increase in demand for port infrastructure to support ammonia storage in liquefied tanks. 
While some of this increased capacity can be integrated into existing plants, either by replacing fossil-based ammonia trading or by improving annual plant utilisation with minor adjustments, the majority will require major expansion. This expansion may become even more critical in the post-2030 period in light of additional demand for ammonia bunkering at ports to support shipping decarbonisation.
 
Anhydrous ammonia is a pure form of ammonia containing over 99% ammonia and no water. 
Hereafter, the term “ammonia” refers to “anhydrous ammonia”. 

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 131  
In addition, countries with good renewable energy resources that have not traditionally been involved in energy or ammonia trade may play an increasingly 
significant role. This transition will require not only new ammonia storage tanks, but also the construction of new deep-water ports and berthing facilities to support these emerging routes.  
Methanol is already stored in more than 120 ports worldwide. Storage of methanol and LOHC at ports requires simpler infrastructure than storage of ammonia, as they use liquid bulk storage, and existing oil storage facilities at ports can be adapted to store methanol and LOHC. 
There are over 100 natural gas liquefaction plants worldwide, situated across more than 40 ports. Additionally, there are over 160 LNG regasification plants in nearly 150 ports. However, the distinct chemical properties of hydrogen and natural gas present a significant challenge in repurposing existing infrastructure. 
The liquefaction of natural gas occurs at -162°C, while the liquefaction of hydrogen requires a much colder temperature of -253°C, at which point even air liquefies. 
This difference in temperature presents a challenge to adapting current facilities for handling pure hydrogen. With the aim of addressing these challenges, many announced regasification projects, especially in Europe, are considering flexible designs to facilitate the transition into multi-molecule hubs in the future. Such hubs could handle synthetic methane without any technical adaptation, and potentially also ammonia or pure hydrogen with a degree of refurbishment and equipment replacement. For instance, in June 2024, Enagás announced plans to assess the feasibility of converting its Musel LNG regasification terminal into a “multi-molecule” facility. In the same month, construction began on Germany’s first land-based LNG terminal, the Hanseatic Energy Hub. This terminal, due to start importing LNG in 2027, is also designed to be “ammonia-ready”, according to the project developers. However, just as in the case of converting already existing terminals, the technical feasibility of converting these newly designed terminals also needs to be demonstrated. Certain elements of the infrastructure available in the terminals (e.g. jetties, berthing facilities) are likely to be easily reusable, but there is other specific equipment (e.g. compressors, heat exchangers) that will require a certain amount of modification or replacement, and there is no real experience of converting them for handling hydrogen-based fuels. On the basis of announced projects, more than 100 new hydrogen and ammonia terminals and port infrastructure projects could be realised by the end of the decade. More than half of all terminals are ammonia export terminals, with more than ten potentially located in Australia.
 
More details on the feasibility of LNG conversion to hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels can be found in the Global Hydrogen Review 2022 and the Energy Technology Perspectives 2023. 
A comprehensive list of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels infrastructure projects in ports can be accessed via the IEA Hydrogen Infrastructure Database (October 2024).

Further terminals are planned in Brazil, Egypt, Namibia, Mauritania and the United Arab Emirates, among other locations. 
Ammonia import terminals account for more than a quarter of all planned terminals. In Europe, a number of ammonia import terminals have been announced in countries including Belgium, Germany and, the Netherlands, and outside Europe, in Japan and Korea. It is worth noting that the capacity of the OCI 
Rotterdam ammonia terminal is being tripled to 1.2 Mt NH3, with completion expected by the end of 2024, after a 1-year delay. In April 2024, Samsung C&T 
signed a contract to build an ammonia import terminal for co-firing power generation at Gangwon-do, Korea, expected to be operational by 2027. 
Nevertheless, there has been limited progress beyond announcements since the GHR 2023. However, Fluxys has initiated several non-binding calls for interest to assess the demand for handling hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels at Belgian ports (Table 4.5).

Description 

Zeebrugge, Belgium 
November 2023 - February 2024 
Fluxys launched a non-binding call for interest for its expansion plans for the Zeebrugge terminal. The call included infrastructure for conventional and synthetic LNG as well as hydrogen and ammonia. 

Antwerp, Belgium 
June 2024 
Fluxys launched a non-binding call for interest for a new ammonia terminal in the port of Antwerp, including plans for an ammonia pipeline. 

Eemshaven, Netherlands 
June 2024 
Gasunie and Vopak launched a non-binding call for interest on LNG, hydrogen and CO2 infrastructure at the EemsEnergyTerminal at the port of Eemshaven (Groningen). 
 
Several large-scale ammonia cracking projects have also been announced in addition to related port infrastructure, although the technology is not yet proven on a commercial scale. Facilities are being considered in Wilhelmshaven, Rostock and Brunsbüttel (Germany), in the port of Antwerp (Belgium), in the ports of Liverpool, Newcastle and Immingham (United Kingdom), in the Port of Dunkirk (France) and in the port of Krk (Croatia), as well as three facilities in the port of Rotterdam (the Netherlands). Based on the capacity of the announced projects, ammonia cracking in Europe could supply approximately 2 Mt H2 by 2030. 
Elsewhere, ammonia cracking plants have been announced for the ports of Daesan and Ulsan (Korea), as well as plans for a unit in Singapore. There are 
even plans for the construction of an offshore ammonia cracking terminal in Germany. In July 2024, Deutsche ReGas and Höegh LNG entered into a 
preliminary agreement to develop the H2 Import Terminal Lubmin in Germany. 
The terminal would have an output capacity of 30 ktpa H2 and the cracker is set to become operational in 2026. Construction of the pilot project for the Höegh ammonia cracker is underway in Stord, Norway.

Tankers for shipping hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels
Existing tankers can carry hydrogen-based fuels (e.g. ammonia, methanol) and LOHCs. Ammonia, a gas at ambient temperature, requires liquefied gas tankers, 
while methanol, synthetic fuels and LOHCs, being liquids, can be shipped in chemical (including dedicated methanol tankers) or oil product tankers. 
Currently, around 40 tankers are exclusively dedicated to the transport of ammonia, with up to 200 liquefied gas tankers capable of carrying ammonia, such 
as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tankers, as they have similar liquefaction points (-44°C for LPG and -33°C for ammonia). According to shipping analytics firm Vortexa, between mid-2021 and mid-2023, 114 unique tankers had loaded ammonia, with a combined capacity of around 3.1 million m3, equivalent to around 
2 Mt of ammonia loading capacity. While the fleet includes several very large gas tankers, with a capacity of over 70 000 m3, ammonia is usually shipped by midsize tankers (25 000-50 000 m3) due to the typical parcel sizes and the availability of port infrastructure. New orders for ammonia tankers have already increased, reflecting shipowners’ anticipation of rising demand for ammonia cargoes in the coming years. However, an increase in the number of tankers may be constrained by the relative technical complexity of liquefied gas tankers, with only a few shipbuilding yards in Korea, Japan and China capable of constructing them. This limited shipbuilding capacity could potentially create bottlenecks in the short term, and there have already been reports of a lack of capacity in Korean shipyards. 
New orders for midsize gas tankers have also been on the rise since 2023, boosted by the demand for dual-fuel vessels, the anticipated growth in low-
emissions ammonia trade, and drought-induced restrictions at the Panama Canal, which favour the transit of midsize gas tankers. In the first half of 2024, 20 midsize gas tankers were ordered, approaching the 2023 total of 26 orders. There has also been a surge in orders for very large gas tankers, with 21 in 2023, and 26 during the first half of 2024, with most set to be delivered from 2027. These tankers will initially serve the LPG market until the ammonia market matures. However, there are some concerns of potential overcapacity in the very large gas tanker segment, including for LPG/ammonia tankers. 
Decarbonising the shipping of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels remains a significant challenge, which also affects the carbon intensity of low-emissions 
hydrogen when considering both production and transport-related emissions. 
Existing gas carrier fleets can potentially be adapted for low-emissions marine fuels, depending on the space required for new tanks and additional equipment. 
The decarbonisation of ammonia, chemical and product tankers needs to progress in parallel to the growth of low-emissions hydrogen trade. In 2016, the first dual-fuel methanol tankers that can run on their methanol cargo were introduced, and by early 2023, there were 23 dual-fuel methanol tankers, with more orders on the way. In the same year, the first orders for ammonia-fuelled ships were placed at the Hyundai Mipo Dockyard in Korea, starting with a pair of midsize LPG/ammonia gas tankers ordered by EXMAR in October 2023, that will be propelled by dual-fuel engines and are expected to be delivered by 2026.

Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure 
PAGE | 134  
In May 2024, Trafigura placed an order with the same dockyard in Korea for four ammonia-fuelled midsize LPG/ammonia tankers, with the first expected to be delivered in 2027. In August 2019, the ammonia-fuelled medium gas carrier being developed by a consortium of NYK and Nihon Shipyard received the world’s first “Machinery Room Safety for Ammonia” accreditation granted by ClassNK. 
There are currently no commercially available tankers for shipping liquefied hydrogen. The Suiso Frontier, with a capacity of 1 250 m3 (~75 t H2), is to date the only demonstration project and completed a shipment of liquefied hydrogen from Australia to Japan in 2022. Several companies are working on the development of liquefied hydrogen tankers, expected to be operational by 2030, with hydrogen cargo capacities of up to 160 000 m3 (~9 600 t H2) (Table 4.6). In addition, the use of hydrogen to fuel ships could have positive spill-over effects, as these technologies could be incorporated into liquefied hydrogen tankers, allowing part of the cargo to be used as fuel.

Highlights 
 In 2023, USD 3.5 billion was spent globally by project developers on hydrogen supply projects that are under construction. Around 80% of this was for projects building electrolysis facilities and the rest on projects coupling hydrogen production with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). For 
electrolysers, this was an increase of over 350% compared with 2022, mostly for the industrial and refining sectors. Spending on infrastructure projects – 
pipelines, storage and refuelling – remains at a much lower level. 
 Half of the spending on electrolysis projects was in China in 2023 and one-third in Europe. China leads on annual investment due to the large numbers and 
sizes of projects, which offset lower unit costs than in other countries. If all Chinese projects that have achieved a final investment decision (FID) are 
delivered to plan, spending there would rise 140% in 2024. Spending on CCUS-equipped hydrogen projects was highest in North America. 
 Investment spending on electrolysis projects could rise by as much as 150% in 2024, based on recent FIDs. Spending on CCUS-equipped plants will also 
increase in the coming years. Four projects representing around 1 Mtpa in total for hydrogen production with CO2 capture and storage took FID since last year’s report, including new facilities and retrofits of existing plants. For both production routes, the largest projects are reaching industrial scales and this trend, coupled with recent cost inflation, is driving up investment, despite some project delays. 
However, annual investment of USD 50 billion is needed this decade to get on track with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario). 
 While hydrogen company valuations have struggled recently on public markets, hydrogen start-ups successfully increased the total equity funding they raised to USD 3.7 billion in 2023. Project developers for industrial hydrogen uses and technology developers for hydrogen production dominated this total, but deals so far in 2024 show more technology variety. 
 Several innovation milestones have been achieved in the past year, and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis and catalytic decomposition of 
methane to make hydrogen both moved up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Promising tests of ammonia combustion in boat engines and power plants have also been reported.

Investment in the hydrogen sector 
This report covers four different types of investment that, when considered together, provide an overview of the capital being committed to the scale-up of a commercial-scale hydrogen industry and an indication of private sector confidence in hydrogen projects and firms. 
The largest category of investment is spending by project developers on projects that have already taken FID and are under construction. For low-emissions 
hydrogen production, we estimate this to have reached USD 3.5 billion globally in 2023, around 80% of which was for projects building electrolysis facilities for hydrogen production, and the rest for projects coupling hydrogen production with CCUS. However, given the different unit costs of these types of investments (partly because some CCUS projects are retrofits of existing hydrogen plants), these relative shares change when considering the expected annual output of projects in construction around the world in 2023, to 55% for hydrogen produced through electrolysis and 45% for facilities with CCUS (see Chapter 3). Recent FIDs for large CCUS-equipped projects look set to support this balance over coming years. 
However, spending on infrastructure projects – pipelines, storage and refuelling – remains at a much lower level. 
Spending on hydrogen supply projects under construction was over 350% higher in 2023 than 2022, and is expected to grow further in 2024 as work ramps up on 
projects that took FID in 2023 and since the start of 2024. Many of these projects have electrolysis capacities of over 100 MW and up to 2 GW in one case. 
However, as described in Chapter 3. Hydrogen production, concerns about costs and regulation continue to delay the time taken for some projects to reach FID. In addition, for projects achieving financial close, inflation means that costs are often higher today than when the projects were first proposed, a trend that is inflating future investment projections without increasing the associated expected hydrogen production. The Bad Lauchstädt Energy Park 30 MW project in Germany, which took FID in June 2023, has experienced cost increases of 50% since the initial engineering design. Another source of high costs is insurance against performance risks for this new type of industrial activity without an established track record. New, dedicated products are emerging to make it easier to insure projects in the early stages of market development, but so far they have limited scope and unknown prices. 
Since the Global Hydrogen Review 2023 (GHR 2023), several policy developments have raised the prospects of higher investment in hydrogen projects in coming years. Japan passed its Hydrogen Society Promotion Act, which includes a budget of JPY 3 trillion (USD 20 billion) and provisions for 15-year contract-for-difference production subsidies for domestic and imported hydrogen and ammonia. In the European Union, the third (infrastructure projects) and fourth rounds (mobility projects) of Important Projects of Common European Interest saw EUR 8.3 billion (USD 9 billion) in total of national public support approved for 46 projects, with total costs of twice this amount.

Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation 
PAGE | 137  
In the United States, USD 7 billion in grants was awarded to seven consortia planning hydrogen “hubs” that have total estimated capital costs of USD 50 billion. The 2024 Australian Budget included a hydrogen production tax incentive worth AUD 6.7 billion (USD 4.5 billion) which individual projects may claim for up to 10 years, and a further AUD 2 billion (USD 1.3 billion) for large-scale hydrogen projects via the Headstart programme was also announced. The USD 2.6 billion of OPEX support awarded to 11 projects under the United Kingdom’s first Hydrogen Allocation Round is intended to facilitate GBP 413 million (USD 525 million) in UK projects by 2026. The first auction of the European Hydrogen Bank awarded operational support worth EUR 720 million (USD 780 million) to seven projects for 10 years. The second round, to be launched in late 2024, is expected to almost triple the total pot. Germany announced a new tranche of EUR 3.5 billion (USD 3.8 billion) for its H2Global double-auction scheme, and the Dutch government joined the H2Global process. France agreed grants of more than EUR 140 million (USD 150 million) to two individual projects. These and other policy developments are described in more detail in Chapter 6. Policies. 
The other types of investment covered in this section include commitments of multilateral development banks (MDBs) to provide finance for hydrogen efforts, 
especially in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). After a flurry of announcements in 2023, this type of investment has seen less activity in 2024. 
The section also includes equity investment in hydrogen-focused companies and funds, including those listed on public exchanges and start-ups raising venture capital. While the value of investments in the former has declined since GHR 2023 amid uncertainty about major contracts for equipment supplies, the latter rose to nearly USD 3.7 billion, signalling that investors continue to see significant long-term market value in high-performing hydrogen technologies. Spending on hydrogen supply projects in construction The amount of money flowing to hydrogen projects continues to grow rapidly, 
demonstrating that new assets – especially for the production of hydrogen – are getting financed on commercial terms. This is despite the various headwinds 
facing developers, which are described throughout this report. 
Electrolysis The majority of investment in 2023 was in the deployment of hydrogen electrolysers and associated equipment. Investment in electrolysers continued its growing trend to reach a record high of USD 2.9 billion in 2023, almost five times the level reached in 2022. This trend is expected to continue in 2024, with investment increasing 150% compared to 2023.

Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation 
PAGE | 138  
Even though the rate of deployment is impressive, it still represents only 6% of the USD 50 billion that needs to be invested on average annually until 2030 in order to get on track with the NZE Scenario. 
Spending is rising in all regions and our 2024 estimate includes spending on close to 50 projects, across five continents, that have taken FID since GHR 2023. This spending is in addition to the continued investment in 2024 in projects that had already started construction before GHR 2023. Among the projects that have taken FID since GHR 2023, the largest is Greenko ZeroC, an ammonia production project in eastern India that is sited at an existing urea plant and is designed to have 1.3 GW of electrolysers. Following FID in August 2024, its developers aim to export ammonia to Europe from 2026. 
More spending is occurring in China than any other region, despite the revocation of development rights by authorities in Inner Mongolia for several projects in the region (accounting for more than 3 GW of electrolysis capacity). Given the lower costs in China, this will result in an even higher share of capacity additions when these projects under construction enter operation. Among the largest projects that have taken FID since GHR 2023 are the Taonan Green Methanol project (with around 700 MW of electrolysis), the Tianying Green Methanol project (around 670 MW of electrolysis) and the Fengzhen, project in China will have over 650 MW of proton exchange membrane (PEM) capacity, making it the largest PEM project in the world. Also in China, Goldwind, a Chinese wind energy manufacturer, and Mærsk, a Danish shipping giant, are collaborating on a 550 MW project to make hydrogen for methanol production by 2026. China is continuing to build more large projects than any other country, driven by the strategies of state-owned enterprises, concessional finance from local government and rules to limit renewable electricity curtailment. If all Chinese projects that have reached FID are delivered according to their development plans, spending there would rise 140% in 2024 compared with 2023.

Notes: 2024 values are estimated annualised spending on projects that had begun construction by mid-2024. Estimates are based on capital cost assumptions and announced capacities of electricity input or hydrogen output volumes per project and include electrolysers for hydrogen supply used for energy purposes or as an alternative to fossil fuel use in industry (such as chemical production and oil refining). “Other” includes buildings heating, combined heat and power, grid injection, biofuels upgrading and unspecified uses.

Investment in electrolysers is on a steep growth trajectory: the record investment of 2022 almost quintupled in 2023, and a further 150% growth is anticipated through 2024. 
In Europe, investment is expected to rise 140% in 2024 compared to 2023 and to continue to account for around one-third of global investment in electrolysers. Among the FIDs taken in Europe since GHR 2023, the Boden steel plant being built by Stegra – formerly H2 Green Steel – for 2030 in Sweden is the largest in terms of electrolysis capacity, at 700 MW of electrolysis capacity. The FID, in April 2024, was for a total plant cost of over USD 7 billion, making it the world’s largest hydrogen-related project in terms of financial scale. In Germany, EWE has taken FID on a 320 MW electrolysis plant in Emden and RWE is constructing 300 MW of electrolysis at its GET H2 Nukleus project in Lingen, both of which will serve industrial hydrogen consumers. Four projects installing around 100 MW each took FIDs to supply hydrogen to the refining, mobility and biofuel upgrading sectors: 
CCU-HUB Aalborg methanol project in Denmark; CRI’s Circlenergy methanol project in Norway; Galp’s Grey2Green project on the site of a decommissioned 
coal-fired power plant in Portugal67;and a project of Shell in Germany to expand the 10 MW “REFHYNE” electrolyser already operating at its Rheinland refinery. 
Two other projects larger than 50 MW took FID in Germany (with USD 130 million of public grants) and Romania (with USD 50 million of public grants) for industrial uses, vehicle refuelling and biofuel upgrading. Each of these projects likely suffered cost inflation since the first estimates were made.
 
The project has received USD 30 million in public grants and has applied for IPCEI support from the Portuguese government to cover a share of the private costs. 

Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation 
PAGE | 140  
In the United States, which accounts for about 12% of global investment in electrolysers today, a 100% increase in electrolyser investment in 2024 is 
foreseen. Two projects have taken FID since GHR 2023, the larger of which involves building an 80 MW electrolyser facility by 2026 for refuelling trucks. The USD 550 million capital cost is expected to be borne by the promoter, Fortescue, and recovered via the 45V tax credit, pending final guidance for 45V. The other project is for 40 MW of electrolysis to produce liquefied hydrogen to be delivered by road to customers in the material handling, vehicle refuelling and stationary power sectors from the end of 2024. While the direct policy support for the investment is unclear, the supplier, Plug, benefits from concessional finance and grants for manufacturing from the US government. Overall, US investments since GHR 2023 may have been higher if clarification of the rules for implementation of 45V – including the time-matching requirements for renewable electricity inputs – had not been delayed further, with market players still awaiting the decision on the final rules, expected later this year. Uncertainty relating to the outcome of the US election in 2024 and its impact on hydrogen support policies is also impeding investment. 
Outside these major regions, there was notable FID activity in Australia and Malaysia. In Parak, Malaysia, a local renewable energy developer is working with a Chinese power company to construct 60 MW of electrolysis capacity, powered by floating solar PV, at a capital cost of around USD 400 million. The intended use of the hydrogen from this project remains unclear. In Australia, the 55 MW electrolyser being built by Origin Energy, to be powered by grid electricity, will supply Orica’s ammonia fertiliser production. It is supported by USD 75 million in central and state-level government grants, and is part of a shortlist for receipt of production subsidies. Fortescue took FID on both phases of its 50 MW electrolyser installation project linked to a new electrolyser factory that has received USD 30 million from the state government towards USD 76 million capital costs. 
Fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage In contrast, investment in projects under construction for producing low-emissions hydrogen with CCUS stood at only USD 0.7 billion in 2023, though this was more than double the amount in the previous year. However, deployment of such projects appears set to ramp up, with six FIDs since GHR 2023, including for what is currently the world’s largest potential project to produce low-emissions hydrogen. To date, much of the investment in hydrogen production equipped with CCUS has been in North America, including several entirely new hydrogen production facilities. However, of the six FIDs since GHR 2023, three were in the Netherlands and were for retrofitting existing hydrogen production plants. 

Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation 
PAGE | 141  
Among the CCUS projects in construction in the Netherlands, the two largest are both for hydrogen supply to the Botlek/Pernis refinery and other onsite industrial customers from 2026. Both involve capturing CO2 from the production of roughly 0.1 Mtpa H2 each from existing hydrogen production plants. These two projects will receive a 15-year contract from the Sustainable Energy Production and Climate Transition Incentive Scheme (SDE++) under which the government will top up any difference between the cost of hydrogen production with CCUS and without. The projects will pay a pipeline operator to take away the CO2 for offshore geological storage via new infrastructure that is also under construction, having received around USD 120 million in Dutch and EU government grants. The third project in the Netherlands to have recently reached FID is slightly smaller, but still very large by the standards of the emerging low-emissions hydrogen sector. It is for CO2 capture from the production of hydrogen for ammonia and will capture and store around 45% of the CO2 that is not used elsewhere, either onsite in the production of fertiliser or by third parties. This captured CO2 – and associated payments – will be passed to the operator of a service for shipping CO2 to Norway for offshore geological storage. Due to the CO2 being stored outside of the country, the plant is 
considered ineligible for an SDE++ contract, but part of its USD 200 million costs will be covered with a USD 30 million grant from the Netherlands. 
The largest FID – in terms of budget and potential to produce low-emissions hydrogen – since GHR 2023 was in the United States. To put the scale of the 
Eastern Louisiana Hydrogen Complex in context, its projected hydrogen output would be three times larger than the roughly 0.2 Mtpa H2 from the world’s largest electrolyser project currently under construction, the NEOM project in Saudi Arabia, despite having a similar capital cost, at USD 7 billion. Its projected output is equivalent to roughly all the low-emissions hydrogen produced globally in 2023. 
However, despite its high CO2 capture rate of 95%, whether all the hydrogen from the Louisiana project will be low-emissions hydrogen will depend on the associated emissions from the fossil fuel lifecycle, notably any upstream methane emissions. 
Another large FID was taken in February 2024 for a natural gas-based ammonia facility in the United Arab Emirates that will enter operation in 2027 without CCUS, before adding CO2 capture by 2030. The project, which has Japanese contractors, has received concessional finance as an export credit loan of USD 27 million. 
  
One of the two project promoters, Air Liquide, issued a EUR 500 million (USD 540 million) green bond in May 2024 to help finance these types of projects. 
While the capital costs per unit of hydrogen production are lower than for NEOM, the costs of hydrogen production will depend on operational and fuel costs and these are likely to be higher than those of the NEOM project, which does not need to procure external energy supplies. 
Air Products’ indication that its plan for the plant’s finances include the 45Q CO2 storage tax credit suggest that the upstream methane conditions of the more lucrative 45V hydrogen tax credits might be difficult to meet. Other public support for this project is expected to come from a performance-based grant of up to USD 5 million from the state of Louisiana (including workforce development support) and the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programmes. 

Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation

Investment decisions for hydrogen production with CCUS have continued in 2024. 
In June 2024, Shell announced an FID for the Polaris project in Canada, which will capture CO2 from a steam methane reformer, among other sources, for 
geological storage in the Atlas Carbon Storage Hub from 2028. In addition to the Polaris FID, Shell and partner ATCO EnPower announced FID to proceed with the Atlas Carbon Storage Hub. 
Infrastructure 
There was some activity in the area of infrastructure development, which nevertheless still has the largest gap to fill – current investment levels are less 
than 5% of what is needed to get on track with the NZE Scenario projections in 2030. 
One notable development is the expected start in mid-2024 of the construction of the world's longest hydrogen pipeline, in China, at a cost of USD 845 million, expected to be completed in 3 years. No other hydrogen pipelines have reached FID since GHR 2023, though in June 2024 German gas transmission operator Bayernets secured a USD 230 million credit facility for the construction of a 40 km hydrogen-ready gas pipeline by the end of 2025. In the same month, the European Commission approved the German government’s request to make USD 3.2 billion in financial guarantees available for the construction of hydrogen pipelines in Germany this decade. Fluxys, a Belgian pipeline operator, declared in August 2024 its intention to spend USD 2.2 billion on hydrogen infrastructure over the next 10 years, three times more than previously foreseen. For cross-border pipelines, a first step is typically a co-operation agreement between the countries concerned, and, in 2024, such an agreement was signed between Austria, Germany and Italy for the proposed Southern Hydrogen corridor connecting Europe with North Africa, which is one of five components of the European Hydrogen Backbone initiative. 
On the storage side, Chevron bought 78% of the USD 1 billion Advanced Clean Energy Storage hydrogen project in Utah, United States, in September 2023 after 
declining to do so in 2022, even though the project had already secured offtakers and a USD 0.5 billion loan guarantee from the US government. This reversal 
indicates that the project’s economics meet the requirements of an oil major, and that Chevron is now more enthusiastic about gaining a foothold in hydrogen 
distribution in the region. Elsewhere, repurposed salt caverns are also planned to be used for large-scale hydrogen storage in Lower Saxony, Germany. The Etzel project in the region remains at a pilot stage, which the federal and state governments have funded with a low double-digit million Euro investment for over a third of the total project costs.

For hydrogen refuelling stations, Hydrogen Refuelling Solutions secured USD 3.4 million in bank finance to expand its test facility in France for research 
into heavy-duty vehicle operations. The financing is counter-guaranteed by French state-owned banks. 
Multilateral financial commitments are moving into the implementation phase After a slew of very large announcements in 2023 (USD 4.8 billion), less 
multilateral finance has been announced so far in 2024 (USD 1.8 billion). The largest announcement is the second tranche of USD 1.5 billion of debt from the 
World Bank to India, all for hydrogen. This new large allocation of concessional debt lifts the World Bank to representing over half of all multilateral finance for hydrogen since 2022 and India to be the recipient of nearly 60% of the total. 
Notable other examples since GHR 2023 include World Bank funding of USD 135 million to Brazil for hydrogen infrastructure development, which may be 
further boosted following a Memorandum of Understanding signed at COP 28 that foresees a further USD 1 billion for hydrogen-related projects in Brazil. The World Bank also granted a USD 150 million loan to Chile in 2023. 
MDBs and development finance institutions have a strategic role to play in supporting EMDEs to become first movers in developing a market for low-
emissions hydrogen. They can support governments to attract private sector investment by improving enabling conditions, and accepting or mitigating some of 
the early risks related to individual projects and the low-emissions hydrogen sector more generally, in addition to non-sector-specific risks impacting EMDEs, such as currency volatility. Moreover, they can support countries in defining policy frameworks that catalyse local socio-economic benefits and support the energy transition in line with national development agendas.  
The lower levels of announcements in 2024 can be interpreted as a shift by the large MDBs from building partnerships and high-level finance agreements with 
recipient countries to working on the details for how to implement previously approved programmes, rather than scouting for new opportunities. Many of the 
renewable electricity-based hydrogen projects funded by MDBs have long lead times, significant social and regulatory aspects, and complex engineering 
challenges to resolve, requiring extensive planning and co-ordination for these projects to achieve their promised impact. The approved large-scale programmes cover many of the countries that could reasonably invest large sums in hydrogen deployment in the near-term without extensive capacity building. In contrast, much of the new funding that has been announced since GHR 2023 focuses on technical assistance to help build capacity in other developing economies that could become major project hosts in future. In the NZE Scenario, more than USD 365 billion is needed in EMDEs by 2030.

India and Brazil have been the recipients of the largest MDB financing agreements since 2022, with the World Bank and EIB responsible for around 90% of the total. In 2024, the World Bank approved a USD 1.5 billion loan to India for promoting hydrogen from renewable energy, scaling up renewable electricity and enhancing finance for low-carbon energy investments. This follows a similar loan to India for the same amount announced in 2023. A USD 100 million loan is also earmarked for Mauritania for institutional capacity building for low-emissions hydrogen projects and minerals mining, building on previous smaller grants for studies in the country. In June 2024, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) approved a loan of USD 55 million to Uzbekistan for its first renewable hydrogen production project, which is expected to create an example for similar projects in Central Asia. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) announced USD 2 million of technical co-operation with Colombia for the development of renewable hydrogen, among other projects. The private sector financing arm of the IDB (IDB Invest) has proposed a USD 35 million loan to Renewstable Barbados Ltd to develop hydrogen storage facilities.  
Bilateral funding agreements are also supporting hydrogen development in EMDEs. Recent examples include a EUR 20 million (USD 22 million) grant from 
Germany to Algeria, and cumulatively around USD 3 million of grant from the United States and United Kingdom, to Namibia, Uzbekistan and South Africa in 
separate agreements. France has indicated it may loan EUR 350 million (USD 380 million) to Morocco, in addition to a EUR 0.8 Million (USD 0.9 million) 
grant for hydrogen projects agreed in mid-2024. Increasingly, bilateral finance also includes examples of “south-south” co-operation, such as USD 5 million of loan from South Africa to a company developing hydrogen projects in Namibia.

Financial performance of hydrogen firms 
In aggregate, the commercial health of companies that have staked their future success on low-emissions hydrogen is not yet robust. Many of these companies 
are scaling up new businesses and therefore necessarily putting significant capital at risk (e.g. in factories or project equity) to be able to take orders for equipment sales. However, just as project orders have picked up, as projects begin to reach financial close, these young companies have been hit by higher costs of capital and expectations of further project delays.  
In order to track investment trends in hydrogen-related businesses, we have assembled a portfolio of 45 publicly traded companies in the sector. While the 
monthly investor returns and revenues of this portfolio rose over the past 5 years, its recent performance is more reflective of the troubled S&P Cleantech index, rather than the NASDAQ index that is dominated by hardware-light digital technology firms. The combined capitalisation of the firms in the portfolio has been on a steady downward trajectory since 2021, reflecting the difficult balance between needing to spend on R&D, facilities and projects while revenue is not yet covering costs, and the cost of capital on private markets is rising in competition with other investment options. Continued increases in interest rates have led investors to withdraw equity from sectors struggling to meet shareholder requirements. By the end of February 2024, the market capitalisation of the portfolio had dropped back to its level in May 2020. 
As a reflection of investor wariness about new, capital-intensive sectors such as low-emissions hydrogen, there have been no major new additions to the portfolio since the initial public offering of thyssenkrupp nucera in 2023. The one listing that occurred was via a merger of Apex Group, a project developer, with a listed company that had previously undergone a de-SPAC in 2011 – a relatively low risk transaction. Some existing portfolio members did raise additional capital, though the total amount was relatively small. Among these, McPhy raised USD 33 million to help finance its electrolyser factory. 
Moreover, there are signs that companies are taking measures to try to shore up the most viable parts of their businesses. For example, ITM Power sold its 
refuelling business in late 2023. Nel is spinning off its refuelling business as Cavendish Hydrogen from its electrolyser business, in an effort to separate the risks of these two different segments, and McPhy has undertaken something similar. These trends reflect other corporate measures to scale back expectations for refuelling network expansion and profitability, and also reflect the reduced need for electrolyser manufacturers to play a role in creating the market for smaller-scale HRS projects as demand increasingly comes from large-scale industrial projects (see Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand).

Despite more hydrogen projects attracting investment, financial markets continue to be cautious about the prospects of individual specialist companies in the supply chain. Some project companies are exploring new business models that are “asset light” and can help spread risks and bring new sources of capital into project development. For example, Lhyfe, a company whose share price has fallen 40% in the past year, is proposing a new model of co-development of projects to be sold to co-owners once operational. Other companies are looking at new types of partnerships that help bring in capital, such as the tie-up between John Cockerill and SLB. In contrast, larger multinationals that are not solely focused on hydrogen have more options for raising capital at lower costs. The values of specialist exchange-traded hydrogen funds have been badly hit since GHR 2023, reflecting investors’ scepticism that they will quickly find enough profitable companies and projects to beat market averages. No new funds have been launched. The Clean H2 Infra Fund, which is not publicly traded, has been cautiously spending its EUR 2 billion (USD 2.1 billion) war chest that was raised in 2022, and joined investment rounds for Stegra and HysetCo. Its manager is currently trying to raise a further USD 500 million for investment in hydrogen-related equipment manufacturing, and has used money raised so far to invest in Hexagon Purus, a maker of hydrogen storage systems. Similarly, the sixth investment made by Antin’s USD 1.3 billion NextGen Infrastructure Fund I was in GTL Leasing, a US-based hydrogen transport and storage equipment leasing firm.

In a young sector like hydrogen, where corporate viability is so dependent on government policy, the precarious financial position of these high-potential firms – which could supply the technologies needed to accelerate energy transitions – should be a priority for government attention. There may be a role for national banks, as exemplified by the partnership between the Canadian Infrastructure Bank and HTEC to accelerate infrastructure development. A fund may be 
launched in India, but at the moment it remains just a proposal. 
Venture capital and private equity Venture capital (VC) investment has continued to increase, reaching a new high of USD 3.7 billion in 2023, but the rate of growth slowed down due to macroeconomic conditions that impacted the amount of capital available for venture investments across the global economy. Hydrogen-related VC funding held up better than total energy-related VC funding, which outperformed total VC funding across all sectors in terms of equity raised. However, we estimate that persistently high interest rates are likely to depress the 2024 total and result in the first significant annual dip in hydrogen-related VC for a decade. 
Some of the concerns of investors include the barriers to entry due to sky-high valuations of some of the hydrogen companies (which also make it difficult to see viable exit pathways for investors), and the difficulty of derisking an entirely new business for scalability, with inherent technological uncertainties and often lacking established supply chains – all while operating in a climate of limited demand. 
Greater momentum in the investment pipeline for hydrogen project deployment will help clarify expected future returns and valuations of hydrogen-related start-ups. On the other hand, it will also accelerate the necessary process of winnowing the cohort of competing start-ups as more is learned about the effectiveness and competitiveness of their technologies and processes. 
Equity investment in start-ups with technologies for hydrogen production represented more than one-third of the 2023 total. Electric Hydrogen, a US 
electrolyser company, raised USD 380 million in October 2023 and Amogy, also in the United States, raised USD 150 million to develop a technology for 
converting ammonia to hydrogen fuel.71 Some of the equity for these deals came from oil and gas companies, which together invested about USD 55 million in start-ups working on various hydrogen production technologies. Ohmium, another US-based electrolyser maker, raised USD 250 million in growth equity in 2023. Large bets on electrolysis technologies continued in early 2024 when Sunfire, a German electrolyser maker, raised USD 230 million of growth equity, complemented by a USD 110 million loan from the EIB.
 
As an example of how VC funding can be combined with other finance sources, Electric Hydrogen received USD 50 million of equipment financing in March 2024, USD 65 million in US government grants and tax credits in April 2024, and USD 100 million in corporate credit in May 2024. 

Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation

Another start-up developing an electrolyser, Australia’s Hysata, raised around USD 75 million in May 2024. Natural hydrogen also attracted investors in 2023, with Koloma, a US-based technology developer, raising USD 91 million in 2023 and USD 245 million in early 2024. In the area of methane pyrolysis technology, Rotoboost, a Norwegian start-up, raised USD 10 million in June 2024, and Sakowin, a French start-up, raised USD 4 million in February 2024. 
Figure 5.4 Venture capital investment in energy start-ups in hydrogen-related areas, per technology domain, 2010-2024

Other end-uses include steel production, chemicals, waste management and heating. 2024e is a full-year estimate for all hydrogen-related VC based on data up to Q1 2024, which does not provide a high enough confidence level for a breakdown by technology area.

Hydrogen-related start-ups continued to attract record levels of venture capital through 2023, but a slowdown is forecast in 2024 given the challenging macroeconomic climate. 
While VC investment in start-ups developing electrolysis technology grew nearly 50% compared to 2022, investment in other areas related to hydrogen – notably mobility and supply project development – shrank. The funding raised by start-ups developing hydrogen fuel cells fell 80%. Nevertheless, there were notable investments, such as the USD 48 million investment by Hyundai into Estonia-based Elcogen, which designs solid oxide fuel cells, and USD 44 million secured by hydrogen fuel cell company Tangfeng energy. Deals so far in 2024 include around USD 70 million raised by INOCEL, a French start-up developing heavy-duty fuel cells. ZeroAvia raised USD 116 million in November 2023 for fuel cell applications targeted at the aviation sector, but this positive news has been tempered by the bankruptcy in mid-2024 of its competitor Universal Hydrogen after it had raised over USD 100 million since 2021 and successfully made an initial flight in 2023. Among earlier-stage start-ups in the aviation segment, HyLight, a French company, raised USD 4 million in April 2024 to develop its hydrogen-powered airship drone.

Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation
PAGE | 149  
In 2023, the largest single area of hydrogen-related VC investment was for end-uses and industrial applications in particular. However, this was mostly related to more than USD 1.6 billion growth-stage equity raised by Stegra, which is building a commercial-scale steel production plant using hydrogen as the major reactant, and has raised nearly USD 7 billion in public and private finance so far. 
Among the VC funding raised since GHR 2023 by start-ups working on hydrogen infrastructure technologies, Sinoscience Fullcryo raised USD 111 million, in part for gaseous hydrogen storage solutions. Yara invested USD 2.85 million in Azane, an ammonia storage technology developer, and Chevron invested in the ammonia production company Ammobia. Some more mature start-ups have recently raised debt financing, including HTEC’s USD 250 million loan from the Canada 
Infrastructure Bank for building hydrogen refuelling stations. 
In terms of the sources of VC finance for hydrogen-related start-ups, we estimate that 88% has come from investors in advanced economies and China since 2019. The role of investors from other EMDEs remains small, though efforts to boost this are ongoing in some places. In mid-2023, a new accelerator for Indian hydrogen start-ups was launched by a private consortium. 
Most money has come from funds, such as VC funds, that are primarly seeking the largest financial return, as is the case for energy-related start-ups as a whole. 
However, in some technology areas, the share of capital from strategic corporate investors – that are also buying access to technology and knowledge – is higher than the energy-related average. These areas include hydrogen for automotive applications, non-electrolysis production of hydrogen (including from fossil fuels and biomass) and hydrogen-based synthetic fuels. Investments from automotive and oil and gas firms are all playing a major role in these areas. In other segments, such as fuel cell and project development, equity investments by the public sector are more important than for the energy-related cohort on average. Although direct public investment in equity tends to play a smaller role in hydrogen VC, it can act as a strategic investor and help attract private co-investment. Although not for a start-up, this role appears to have motivated the governments of Belgium and its province Wallonia to have taken a stake in an electrolyser company when it raised its capitalisation by almost USD 250 million in mid-2024, with most of the money coming from SLB, an energy technology and services company with extensive oil and gas experience.

The sources of VC funding vary by technology area of the start-ups, with some areas showing higher corporate or public sector equity than the average for all energy-related start-ups. Innovation in hydrogen technologies The readiness of hydrogen technologies varies across the supply chain. Low-emissions hydrogen production technologies are already commercially available but not yet mature, and demand-side innovation is making slow progress, though 
several technologies may be on the cusp of significant advances in technological maturity. 
Innovation in hydrogen production technologies 
Electrolytic hydrogen production technologies are commercially available, but other production technologies for low-emissions hydrogen still need to be proven at scale. In addition, to ensure market uptake, further innovation is needed to reduce production costs by improving efficiency and reducing equipment costs, for example by reducing reliance on critical materials, increasing the stack lifetime, improving the manufacturing process, and designing for recycling. Hydrogen from electrolysis Stack innovation Alkaline and PEM electrolysers are the most mature electrolysis designs and are commercially available, with ongoing innovation efforts aimed at reducing hydrogen production costs.

Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation 
PAGE | 151  
Research on PEM electrolysers focuses on minimising the use of expensive platinum group metal components in catalysts to lower stack costs. In September 2023, H2U Technologies achieved a 25 000-hours durability test with an iridium-free catalyst, outperforming other iridium-free catalysts, which last up to 1 400 hours. In February 2024, Toshiba partnered with Bekaert to commercialise Toshiba’s technology that reduces iridium use by 90%. Solid oxide electrolysers (SOECs) achieve the highest efficiencies among electrolyser designs, although they need to use an external heat source for steam generation, and also face durability challenges, with a typical lifetime of around 2 years. A few projects are currently operating at single-digit MW commercial scales, and innovation is underway, such as at Dynelectro, which is seeking to extend their lifetime to up to 10 years. Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) electrolysers are still at an earlier stage of development, but between 2023 and 2024 Enapter supplied them to several projects around the world, including some projects with a capacity of over 1 MW, with one project already in operation in Germany and two more under construction in the UK and the Netherlands respectively. 
High-pressure electrolysis Innovation efforts to reduce the balance-of-plant costs include increasing hydrogen outlet pressure to minimise the need for compression and associated power requirements, which are costly, as hydrogen users often require high pressure. The European Union-funded HYPRAEL project, which began in 2023, aims to produce hydrogen from alkaline electrolysers at 80-100 bar, significantly higher than current pressurised alkaline electrolysers, with pressures up to 30 bar. In November 2023, Supercritical Solutions demonstrated its 50 kW high-pressure electrolyser at a whisky distillery, producing hydrogen at 220 bar, thereby avoiding downstream hydrogen compressors. Supercritical Solutions and HAMR Energy have since announced plans to further test this technology for methanol synthesis, which needs hydrogen at high pressure. 
Offshore hydrogen production 
Between May and November 2023, Lhyfe's Sealhyfe project successfully tested for the first time a 1 MW electrolyser on an offshore platform off the French coast, despite extreme weather conditions. The second stage is the European Union-backed HOPE project, in which a consortium of companies led by Lhyfe aims to operate a 10 MW offshore hydrogen production plant off the coast of Belgium by 2026. The PosHYdon project in the Dutch part of the North Sea plans to produce hydrogen on a gas platform, and while onshore testing began in May 2024, the 1 MW electrolyser is expected to be transferred offshore by year end, and for the first time, hydrogen will be transported alongside gas via an existing pipeline. In December 2023, the Dutch government launched an interest survey for two offshore hydrogen demonstration projects, and in June 2024, the Minister for Global Hydrogen Review 2024 

Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation 
PAGE | 152  
Climate and Energy Policy announced that a first 30-50 MW demonstration project with a budget of EUR 380 million (~USD 410 million) would be selected in the first half of 2025, to be operational by the end of the decade.  
Hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCUS 
Methane reforming 
In steam methane reforming (SMR), 60% of the CO2 emissions are emitted during hydrogen production in the reformer, and 40% from natural gas combustion in the furnace. Currently, CO2 is captured from the concentrated reformer syngas, but capturing the remaining 40% from diluted furnace flue gas remains costly. 
However, hydrogen production from natural gas with CCUS requires capture rates well above the current 60% achieved in commercial operating plants for the 
hydrogen to be classed as low-emissions. To address this challenge, two plants currently under construction in Canada and United States to become operational in 2025 will use natural gas and CCUS with autothermal reformers (ATR) instead of SMR, which make it easier to achieve high CO2 capture rates by producing a single stream of concentrated CO2. Electrified SMR, where the reformer is heated by an electric current, eliminates the need for costly capture of flue gas emissions. 
In October 2023, Topsoe and Aramco announced a collaboration to build an electrified SMR demonstration plant in Saudi Arabia using Topsoe’s technology. 
In June 2024, Nu:ionic and XRG Technologies announced the first commercial deployment of their electrified SMR, with a capacity of 20 t H2/day. 
Methane pyrolysis
Methane pyrolysis produces solid carbon and hydrogen without gaseous CO2 emissions, thus avoiding the need for CO2 capture. In January 2024, Hazer 
announced the first production of hydrogen and graphite at its commercial demonstration plant in Australia, using thermo-catalytic pyrolysis, and with a 
capacity of 100 tpa of hydrogen. In the same month, Hycamite began the construction of a thermo-catalytic methane pyrolysis demonstration plant in 
Finland, with a capacity of 2 000 tpa H2, which opened in September 2024. 
Emerging technologies for hydrogen production 
Other technologies for low-emissions hydrogen production, such as photocatalytic water splitting, are still at low maturity levels, but some pilot 
projects are underway. For example, in June 2024, the HyPEC project, a collaboration between Qatar Shell Research and Technology Centre and 
academia, announced the production of hydrogen from wastewater and sunlight in a pilot facility in Qatar. In Spain, the Hylios project will develop new titanium-based metal-organic frameworks for photocatalytic wastewater splitting, while Sparc Hydrogen (Australia) has started front-end engineering and design for what could be a first-of-a-kind pilot plant for this technology.

Production of synthetic hydrocarbons 
Despite the lack of large-scale industrial plants for the production of synthetic hydrocarbon fuels, several demonstration plants are seeking to advance relevant technologies. In January 2024, LanzaJet inaugurated its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Georgia, United States, the largest plant using alcohol-to-jet technology to date. It aims to produce 34 million litres of jet fuel and 4 million litres of diesel annually from ethanol and hydrogen, which will be produced using a PEM electrolyser. In March 2024, Infinium's Pathfinder plant in Texas began producing e-diesel from CO2 and hydrogen. Similarly, in May 2024, Turn2X inaugurated a synthetic methane plant in Extremadura, Spain, using a 2 MW electrolyser, with the aim of scaling up the technology in other plants. 
Innovation in hydrogen end-uses 
On the demand side, certain technologies using hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels in applications where there are few alternatives for decarbonisation have yet to be demonstrated at scale. However, ongoing innovation efforts may soon lead to advances in the technological maturity of key end-use technologies. 
Industry 
Iron and steel  
In November 2023, Stegra started construction of the world’s first large-scale 100% H2-based direct reduced iron (DRI) plant in Boden (Sweden), to produce 
around 2.5 Mtpa of steel. At the same time, construction started on the Oshivela project site in Namibia, which aims to produce 15 kilotonnes per year (ktpa) of steel using 100% H2-based DRI technology from HyIron, using an airtight rotary furnace instead of a shaft furnace, which can reduce iron ore powders and result in a more homogeneous product. 
Hydrogen-based DRI typically requires high-grade iron ore pellets, which have limited availability. There are several ongoing projects with different technologies to use lower-grade iron ore. In August 2024, Fortescue started the construction of its USD 50 million Green Metal project in the Pilbara region of Australia, which will use an electric smelting furnace that directly melts and reduces iron ore. This technology can process a range of iron ore grades and impurities, increasing its versatility. The project is expected to start production in 2025 with a capacity of 1.5 ktpa of pig iron. In February 2024, Rio Tinto and BHP iron ore producers partnered with Australian steelmaker BlueScope for the development of an electric smelting furnace pilot plant in the country, which could be commissioned by 2027.

Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation 
PAGE | 154  
In Korea, POSCO aims to have a demonstration plant for fluidised bed reactor technology by 2026, using hydrogen as a reducing agent for fine ore instead of 
iron ore pellets, as in DR shaft furnaces. This will be integrated with an electric smelting furnace that can use DRI from low-grade iron ore. In Japan, Nippon Steel’s R&D programme aims to test hydrogen-based technology for directly reducing low-grade iron ore, jointly developed by Tenova and Danieli, with a demonstration project planned in Hasaki. 
Nippon Steel conducted tests to blend hydrogen in a blast furnace in Q3-4 2023, and achieved a reduction in CO2 emissions of up to 33%. Nippon Steel plans to continue demonstration work and implement its Super COURSE50 technology to achieve up to 50% reduction of CO2 emissions in large-scale blast furnaces. 
Chemicals Commercially available designs for the production of ammonia via the Haber-Bosch process require high temperatures, pressure, and continuous operation with limited flexibility (variable load of 70-110% of nominal capacity). Skovgaard Energy is building a demonstration plant in Lemvig, Denmark that was inaugurated in August 2024 using Topsoe's flexible ammonia synthesis technology with a 5 ktpa ammonia capacity, able to operate from 5-100%. By 2025, Topsoe's technology will be scaled up at the Baotou plant in China, with a planned capacity of 390 ktpa.  
In November 2023, the Leuna100 plant in Germany was inaugurated. This is the world’s first pilot plant to produce methanol from CO2 and hydrogen via co-
electrolysis, using a novel catalytic process which allows load-flexible operation.  
High-temperature heating 
Projects that aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using hydrogen for process heating in different industries are also increasing. In September 2023, in Hofors (Sweden), Ovako inaugurated a plant for heating steel with hydrogen before rolling, equipped with a 20 MW electrolyser. In June 2023, Hydro announced that it had tested aluminium smelting fired by hydrogen at its recycling plant in Navarra (Spain), followed by confirmation in November 2023 that the aluminium meets the requirements to be used by Irizar for electric vehicles. In December 2023, Veidekke’s asphalt plant in Kristiansund (Norway) produced 3 000 tonnes of asphalt using hydrogen as its sole energy source. In April 2024, Schott announced the successful production of optical glass using 100% hydrogen for the first time at its plant in Mainz (Germany), with ongoing quality assessment tests. In February 2024, Holcim announced that it had achieved a hydrogen injection rate of more than 50% in the La Malle cement kiln in France, becoming the first to achieve this level of blending. In July 2023, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency announced funding for the Rio Tinto and Sumitomo Corporation Yarwun Hydrogen Calcination Pilot Demonstration Program, which aims to be the first to use hydrogen calcination in alumina refining.

PAGE | 155  
Construction is expected to start in 2024, 
to include a 2.5 MW electrolyser and the retrofitting of a calciner with a hydrogen burner. R&D is also revealing future needs for innovation: In November 2023, Aurubis reported on its tests on ammonia co-firing with natural gas for processing copper into wire rod, revealing that while technically possible, it proved infeasible due to high nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and a reduction in the quality of the final product. 
Transport 
Methanol-fuelled shipping  
The operation of ships with methanol as a fuel has already been demonstrated with commercial vessels and methanol-capable ships already in operation, 
although they mostly run on traditional shipping fossil fuels today. In January 2024, the world's largest methanol-powered vessel, the “Ane Mærsk” containership, capable of carrying 16 592 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units), made its maiden call at Tanger Med Port, Morocco, and two similar vessels, the “Astrid Mærsk” and the “Antonia Mærsk”, have since set sail. The Ane Mærsk is nearly eight times larger than its predecessor, the feeder vessel “Laura Mærsk”, which was deployed in September 2023. In April 2024, Wärtsilä secured China's largest methanol new-build order for twelve 24 000 TEU containerships, which are expected to be delivered to two shipping lines by 2026. 
Ammonia-fuelled shipping 
Ammonia-fuelled vessels are not yet at the commercial stage, but progress has been made on tests of ammonia-fuelled engines for maritime applications, and 
there are plans for ammonia-fuelled ships to enter service in the next 2 years.  
Wärtsilä announced the commercial availability of the first four-stroke ammonia-fuelled marine engine for smaller vessels in November 2023, and has already signed a contract with Norwegian shipowner Eidesvik to retrofit an already operating vessel. The retrofit is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026, meaning the vessel could become the world’s first ammonia-fuelled in-service ship. Wärtsilä also has plans to install this type of engine in short-sea vessels for Viridis Bulk Carriers, as well as in two medium-sized gas carriers for EXMAR, to be delivered by Hyundai Mipo Dockyards (Korea) in early 2026.
Four-stroke marine engines, which are more compact but heavier, are commonly used in smaller vessels, while the larger 
two-stroke engines are typically used in bigger vessels. 
Short-sea vessels are ships used for the maritime transport of goods over relatively short distances, typically within the 
same continent and not involving the crossing of an ocean.

In July 2023, MAN Energy Solutions began the first combustion tests on a large 
(50-bore) two-stroke ammonia engine, including running at 100% engine load. 
In addition, in December 2023, MAN and BUTTING announced that its first 
selective catalytic reduction converter for an ammonia two-stroke engine had 
passed testing, reducing NOx emissions (which are a concern with ammonia 
combustion) by up to 90%. In April 2024, MAN announced a pilot project to install 
ammonia-fuelled engines in bulk carriers being built by Nihon Shipyard, in 
collaboration with several Japanese companies, with the aim of commercialisation 
by 2027. Furthermore, WinGD's 72-bore ammonia engines, the largest for 
ammonia and with combustion tests expected in 2024 in cooperation with 
Alfa Laval, have been ordered by CMB.TECH for bulk carriers, with first delivery 
by 2025, and for container ships (by 2026), and by AET for dual-fuel Aframax oil 
tankers.  
Hydrogen-fuelled shipping 
The use of hydrogen fuel cells for maritime applications has already been 
demonstrated and the orderbook is growing (see Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand), 
but the use of hydrogen engines in shipping is still at the earlier stages of research. 
In March 2024, Mitsui announced the world’s first test of a two-stroke marine 
engine from MAN running on hydrogen at up to 100% load.  
Hydrogen in aviation  
The direct use of hydrogen in aviation is still in the early stages of development 
and requires significant innovation and demonstration efforts before it can reach 
commercial operation. ZeroAvia continues to test its 600 kW fuel cell propulsion 
system, which was first flight-tested in 2023, with the aim of carrying up to 
19 passengers on commercial flights by 2025. It is also developing a 2-5 MW 
system for aircraft with up to 80 seats, expected by 2027. In September 2023, 
H2FLY completed the first piloted flight using liquefied hydrogen in a small 
demonstrator aircraft, doubling the range of gaseous hydrogen. At the end of 
2023, Airbus ground-tested a 1.2 MW fuel cell system, with in-flight tests on an 
A380 aircraft (with a maximum certified capacity for 853 seats) planned for 2026, 
and in November 2023, Airbus tested a small hydrogen engine in a glider, flying 
for 30 minutes, to study hydrogen contrails. In April 2024, Japan's NEDO announced a grant of JPY 13 billion (Japanese yen) (USD 87 million) to IHI to 
develop a 4 MW fuel cell using liquefied hydrogen for a three-hour flight on an 
aircraft with at least 40 seats by 2029.

The bore of a marine engine refers to the diameter of the engine's cylinders. A 50-bore engine, often used in smaller 
vessels for regional routes, has smaller cylinders than a 72-bore engine, which powers larger vessels suitable for long-
distance international routes.

Electricity generation 
Hydrogen-fuelled technologies 
In October 2023, a consortium of European energy component manufacturers and 
universities demonstrated the use of 100% renewable hydrogen in a 12 MW gas 
turbine in the Hyflexpower project. This followed initial tests in 2022 with blends of 
30% of hydrogen that were gradually increased up to 100%, in a first for the 
generation of electricity integrated with renewable generation of hydrogen. 
Previous work from NEDO, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Obayashi in Japan 
had already demonstrated the use of 100% hydrogen at smaller scale, using a dry 
low NOx combustion method that improves electrical efficiency while lowering 
NOx emissions. In June 2024 Wärtsilä launched a hydrogen-ready engine (which 
can be converted to run on 100% hydrogen) and a fuel-flexible engine that can 
run on hydrogen or natural gas, both of which will be commercially available from 
2025.  
Ammonia-fuelled technologies 
In April 2024 JERA started a 3-month pre-commercial large-scale demonstration 
trial to co-fire 20% of ammonia at its 1-GW Hekinan coal power plant. The results 
of the test were positive, indicating that NOx levels were no higher than from the 
combustion of coal alone, levels of sulphur oxides were 20% lower, nitrous oxide 
emissions were below the detection threshold, and operability was comparable to 
coal-fired operation. Based on these results, and provided that the supply of 
ammonia can be secured, JERA plans to move to commercial operation from 
2027. While efforts in developing this technology have mainly been spearheaded 
by Japanese and Korean companies, in November 2023 Adani Power announced 
its intention to test 20% ammonia co-firing in a 330 MW coal-fired power plant in 
India.

Tracking patent applications 
The latest data on global hydrogen patenting, as measured by international patent 
families (IPFs), shows a jump in applications of 47% globally in 2022. This 
represents a significant break with the steady growth of the previous years. Most of 
the growth came from the patenting of technologies in categories that are primarily 
motivated by climate change concerns, such as those that facilitate low-emissions 
hydrogen production, new approaches to hydrogen storage and avoidance of fossil 
fuels in end-use applications. The data suggest that confidence in future policy-led 
market opportunities for low-emissions hydrogen technologies, as well as additional 
public funding for R&D, are stimulating more new ideas and product designs with 
commercial potential. The year-on-year uptick is too short to extrapolate into the 
future and it is important to note that patenting is typically a lagging indicator of 
innovation direction and funding. Despite these caveats, the data nonetheless appear 
to offer positive news for clean energy innovation and could translate into lower costs 
and improved technology performance in the coming years.

Global hydrogen patenting, as measured by international patent families, jumped by 47% in 
2022, a significant and encouraging break with the trend over prior years. 
Growth in 2022 came from all main regions, but was led by the European Union, 
where patents grew at a much faster rate than in Japan, which had a similar number of hydrogen patent applications in 2021.
  
An international patent family represents an invention for which patent applications have been filed at two or more patent offices 
worldwide. It is used as a means of identifying higher-value patents. 

Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation 
PAGE | 161  
EU hydrogen patent applications rose by 
55% in 2022, taking the region to a level of activity equal to one-quarter of the global 
total. There were also notable increases in the United States (34% year-on-year 
growth), Korea (40% growth) and China (18% growth). The US trend represents a 
significant uptick compared with relative stagnation over the prior two decades. 
Across the different steps in the hydrogen value chain, patenting is not uniform. For 
those technologies categorised as being motivated by climate, activity is led by 
production and end-use technologies. Although the production of ammonia and 
methanol from hydrogen are categorised as established technology areas, they have 
low-emissions applications, and patenting in these areas grew significantly in 2022 – 
by 23% compared with the year before.

future.

Growth in patenting in 2022 was seen in all main regions but led by the European Union, with 
most climate-motivated activity related to hydrogen production and end-use technologies. 
Over the last decade, IPFs for electrolysis have trebled. IPFs for alkaline electrolysis 
have increased but remain lower than for PEM or SOEC, reflecting the greater 
maturity of the technology. IPFs for AEM electrolysis have shown steady growth and 
were responsible for 28% of all the growth in water electrolysis patents in 2022 across 
these four technology types. Patenting in hydrogen production from unabated fossil 
fuels peaked in 2009 but has continued to grow somewhat in recent years. This is 
also likely to be partly related to the growing interest in hydrogen for clean energy 
purposes, as some of the technologies that can improve traditional hydrogen 
production methods may also have crossover potential, for example for producing 
hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCUS or from biomass.

Notes: CLI = Climate technologies; EST = Established technologies; IPFs = international patent families. 
Source: IEA analysis based on data from the European Patent Office.  
Patenting of hydrogen production technologies is growing rapidly, boosted by the rise of 
electrolysis and, to a lesser extent, natural gas-based pathways with CCUS. 
In hydrogen end-use technologies, patenting growth in 2022 was spread across 
almost all areas. Patents for hydrogen use in the automotive sector continue to grow, 
and represented almost two-fifths of the patenting activity related to end-uses, 
including conversion of hydrogen to hydrogen-based fuels and other energy carriers. 
This share has declined in recent years, from a high of 55% in 2019. Growth in 
patenting related to ammonia – both the production and cracking of ammonia – was 
especially strong in 2022. However, in general, patenting of inventions that relate to 
hydrogen conversion remains at a lower level than that for direct end-uses.

Patenting for hydrogen end-use technologies grew markedly in 2022, driven by the continued 
dominance of patenting for automative uses and broader growth across almost all other areas.

Chapter 6. Policies 
Highlights 
 Policy support is now taking strides towards implementation, with almost 
USD 100 billion of public funds being announced, entering into force, or being 
allocated to projects in the past year. Nearly two thirds of these funds are at the 
announcement stage and thus are still uncertain, and 95% come from advanced 
economies, which typically have longer-standing hydrogen strategies. Funding 
for the supply side is 1.5 times higher than for the demand side. 
 Nineteen new hydrogen strategies were published in the past 12 months, 
bringing the total to 60, and now covering countries that account for over 84% 
of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Most of the new strategies were from 
emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), and most new targets 
are for production. This represents just the beginning of the policy-making 
process – so far none of the new targets are binding or tied to specific policies. 
 Funding related to demand-side policies from the past 12 months adds up to 
USD 40 billion. About 20% of these funds target existing applications, while 
more than half – 60% – is for new applications. Policies already in place could 
trigger demand for 6 Mtpa of hydrogen by 2030, which would be equivalent to 
only half of the amount envisaged by announced demand targets, as little as 15-
20% of production targets, and less than 10% of what is needed in the Net Zero 
Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Around two thirds of the funding are from Germany 
alone, through support for industrial decarbonisation and power. 
 Public subsidies were the most common policy instrument in developed 
markets, while tax incentives are common across EMDEs. Competitive bidding 
was used in a diverse range of countries, with auctions carried out in Egypt, 
Europe, India and Oman in order to facilitate market formation, price discovery, 
and competition. Nine countries introduced incentives for electrolyser and fuel 
cell manufacturing, but only six of them have policies already in force. 
 At COP 28, 37 governments committed to pursue mutual recognition of national 
certification schemes based on common design principles. Towards the same 
aim, 14 Latin American countries launched “CertHiLAC”, backed by Multilateral 
Development Banks. In December 2023, the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) published a Technical Specification that provides the 
basis for a full ISO standard for the methodology for determining the GHG 
emissions associated with hydrogen production, conditioning and transport. 
This is expected to be published in 2025/2026. 

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 164  
Overview 
The number of countries with a hydrogen strategy in place continues to increase: 19 
governments have published a new strategy in the past 12 months, principally in 
emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). Coverage increased 
principally in European (7 new strategies), African (4 new strategies), and Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries (3 new strategies). Common drivers 
were decarbonisation, energy security, domestic industrial development and export 
potential. All the new strategies depict a future characterised by strong exports that 
enable the creation of a burgeoning domestic industry, while there is no new strategy 
that envisages importing hydrogen. This also reflects the broader trend across 
strategies published to date. Countries accounting for 84% of global energy-related 
CO2 emissions have now published a hydrogen strategy. 
Policy support is now moving from visions and targets to implementation, with specific 
policies and funding programmes, using various instruments that aim to close the 
cost gap between low-emissions hydrogen and fossil counterparts. In the past year, 
the equivalent of almost USD 100 billion of public funds have been announced, 
entered into force, or been allocated to specific projects to improve the business case 
for low-emissions hydrogen. Although nearly two thirds of these funds are only at the 
announcement stage and are therefore uncertain, they nevertheless indicate 
commitment from governments and progress towards implementation. The vast 
majority – 95% – come from advanced economies, whereas EMDEs currently have 
limited economic incentives for domestic industry development (Figure 6.1). Overall, 
this funding amounts to only a small fraction of the trillions in investment needed to 
achieve net zero goals, but it is significant given the nascent state of the low-
emissions hydrogen industry (see Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation) 
and the need to both demonstrate deployment under different settings and build 
experience across diverse geographies. 
Public funding for the supply side is almost 1.5 times higher than for the demand side. 
This mirrors a similar disparity across strategies between aims to export and plans to 
import. Funding related to supply-side policies that have been introduced in the past 
12 months adds up to almost USD 62 billion, while funding for demand-side policies 
totals USD 40 billion.  
Public subsidies are currently the most common instrument used in developed 
markets, while tax incentives are common across EMDEs. Direct grants, which can 
be critical to reducing the CAPEX premium, de-risking investments and obtaining a 
lower cost of capital, are one of the most common instruments. Almost all (99%) of 
the direct grants were from advanced economies. Almost two thirds of the eleven 
countries using tax incentives were EMDE. Competitive bidding was used on a more 
geographically widespread basis, with auctions for hydrogen production carried out 
across Europe and in India. Incentives covered a wide range, from USD 0.16/kg H2 
(Denmark, through competitive bidding) to USD 10/kg H2 (United Kingdom, through contracts for difference [CfD]).

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 165  
While direct comparison is complicated by differing 
auction and power market designs, and different electricity prices, among other 
factors, all bidding processes contribute to market formation, price discovery, and 
competition that will drive down costs. Competitive bidding was also common on the 
demand side, with auctions for the use of hydrogen and ammonia in the power sector 
launched or planned in Germany, Japan, Korea and Singapore. 
Alongside the development of certification schemes, governments are working to 
clarify the underlying rules and requirements for hydrogen under their respective 
national frameworks. The United States is developing guidelines on qualifications for 
hydrogen under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while the European Commission is 
developing a definition of “low-carbon” under the Hydrogen and Gas Decarbonisation 
Package. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom released an update to its Low-Carbon 
Hydrogen Standard, while Kenya put forward its sustainability criteria for “green” 
hydrogen produced in the country. Brazil moved ahead with the Brazilian Hydrogen 
Certification Scheme (SBCH2), passing legislation that sets a GHG threshold of 
7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for low-carbon hydrogen. Japan proposed GHG thresholds for 
hydrogen, ammonia, synthetic methane, and synthetic fuels under the Hydrogen 
Society Promotion Act, with the rules still to be finalised.

Strategies and targets 
Since the release of the Global Hydrogen Review 2023 (GHR 2023), 3 governments 
have updated their hydrogen strategy and a further 19 – mostly from EMDEs – have 
adopted new national hydrogen strategies (Table 6.1). A total of 58 governments, the 
European Union and the Economic Community of West African States (Figure 6.2), 
accounting for more than 84% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, have now 
adopted hydrogen strategies. Strategies are just the first concrete step towards 
development, and in most cases, they outline the status of and potential for hydrogen 
development, and announce short-term actions. Only later are they translated into 
specific legislation and incentives. As such, most of the legislation in place today 
results from strategies that were announced a couple of years ago, and more recent 
strategy announcements (Table 6.1) are yet to translate into specific legislations with 
legally binding targets or defined incentives.

2030). Estimated investment needs are USD 90 billion. Actions focus on 
RD&D, regulatory support and certification. 

Bhutan 
Electrolyser target of 5 MW by 2030 and 485 MW by 2050 with investment 
needs (for production only) of USD 9 million by 2030 and USD 454 million by 
2050. Estimated maximum hydrogen demand of 4.2 ktpa for steel, 12 ktpa for 
cement, and 52.5 ktpa for road transport. 

Bulgaria 
Roadmap identifying 18 actions across 4 areas to be implemented before 
2026. Actions include enabling measures such as power market design and 
development guides for project construction, and deployment targets such as 
10 pilot projects and 2 hydrogen valleys by 2026. 

ECOWAS 
Regional production target of 0.5 Mtpa by 2030 requiring 4-5 GW of 
electrolysis and a cumulative investment of USD 3-5 billion. Hydrogen 
production target of 10 Mtpa by 2050. 

Egypt 
Targets 1.5 Mtpa of renewable hydrogen by 2030. Focus on industry, 
transport and export. 40 Mtpa CO2 emissions reduction resulting from 
hydrogen use by 2040, and GDP growth of USD 10-18 billion. 

Estonia 
Roadmap for hydrogen deployment across three phases until 2050. Targets 
for the pilot phase (until 2030) include 3-5 hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) 
and 2-40 ktpa of renewable hydrogen. 

Iceland 
Targets domestic hydrogen demand in 2030 of 12 ktpa plus another 24 ktpa 
to satisfy 10% of demand from international aviation. Satisfying this with 
renewable hydrogen would require 237 MW of electrolysis. Investment needs 
for 2030 of USD 1.8-3.2 billion. 2040 demand is estimated to be ten times 
larger (with almost 80% from international aviation). 

Indonesia 
Strategy based on three drivers (decarbonisation, energy security, and 
exports), with nine action areas including hubs, hydrogen use in mini-grids 
and power generation, a carbon pricing scheme, and definition of a hydrogen 
certification scheme. Defines a methodology for establishing priority uses for 
hydrogen based on relevance (for the strategy), impact (expected output) and 
urgency. 

Ireland 
Potential demand for 2050 is estimated to be 0.6-2.2 Mtpa with the bulk 
(between 35% and 65%) coming from aviation (for electro-sustainable 
aviation fuel [e-SAF]). 

Israel 
Hydrogen demand in 2050 ranging from 580 ktpa to 5.3 Mtpa (equivalent to 
10-100% of Israel’s final energy demand in 2021) with the difference coming 
from the power sector. Introduction of a 5.5% combined target for synthetic 
fuels and biofuels by 2033 is under consideration. 

Kazakhstan 
Concept note defining broad areas of action for development, with 6 target 
indicators to measure results, including a 10 GW electrolyser target and up to 
KZT 5 trillion (Kazakhstani Tenge) (USD 11.3 billion) of investments in 
hydrogen by 2040 and a 20% share of domestic supply of technologies. 

Lithuania 
Targets for 2030 of 1.3 GW of electrolysis (129 ktpa), 30 buses and 10 HRS 
(with at least 1 for shipping), and exports of over 5% of domestic production 
by 2050. Electricity demand for the electrolysers in 2050 estimated to be over 
35 TWh, compared to a current national electricity demand just over 13 TWh. 

Malaysia 
The hydrogen roadmap goes together with the national energy transition 
roadmap as one of the key levers to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. 
Targets include the phase-out of fossil-based hydrogen, 3.3 Mtpa of 
renewable hydrogen, and 3 hubs by 2050. An accompanying technology 
roadmap adds more detail. 

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 168  

Mauritania 
Target of 1.5% of the global hydrogen market and up to 1% of the global 
“green” steel market by 2050. Explicit production targets for hydrogen, 
ammonia, “green” steel, methanol and ammonium nitrate. Hydrogen 
production targets of 1.2 Mtpa by 2030 (almost exclusively for exports), 
increasing to 6.5 Mtpa by 2050 (of which 4.3 Mtpa are for export). 

New Zealand 
A public consultation on the hydrogen roadmap closed in November 2023 and 
resulting updates will inform the National Energy Strategy, due by end of 
2024. Estimated 2050 demand of 0.6-1.4 Mtpa, requiring 4.5-9.8 GW of 
electrolysis. Hydrogen is expected to contribute to decarbonisation, economic 
growth and energy security. 

Romania 
Action plan for implementation of the roadmap with 33 actions across 4 
objectives (decarbonisation; “clean” hydrogen production, skills and 
innovation; sectoral coupling and renewables integration). 2030 targets 
include 34.4 ktpa of renewable hydrogen by 2030, 21 500 heavy- and 
medium-duty trucks, and 1.6 GW of combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) 
capacity with 50% renewable hydrogen co-firing. 

Tunisia 
Targets 8.3 Mtpa of total hydrogen production and 87 GW of electrolysis by 
2050, including 6 Mtpa for export. Intermediate milestones for 2030 include 
320 ktpa of hydrogen production, 3.9 GW of electrolysis, and 5 GW of 
renewables. Short-term use is in chemicals and refining, with long-term use in 
aviation (e-SAF), shipping and power. Investment needs for 2050 total 
USD 130 billion. 

Uruguay 
Estimated hydrogen production of 1 Mtpa in 2040, requiring 9 GW of 
electrolysis capacity, with two-thirds of the output exported, and potential 
annual revenue of USD 1.9 billion in 2040. 

Viet Nam 
Production target of 0.1-0.5 Mtpa by 2030 and 10-20 Mtpa by 2050. 
Australia (update) 
0.5 Mtpa production target by 2030 requiring 3 GW of electrolysis with a 
stretched target of 1.5 Mtpa. Base 2030 export target of 0.2 Mtpa with a 
stretch potential of 1.2 Mtpa. About 30% of the 2030 demand is expected to 
come from aluminium production. Hydrogen could represent 30% of final 
energy use in road transport by 2050 and 45% in road freight. 

Czech Republic 
(update) 
Update based on the latest market conditions and EU legislation. Strategy is 
divided into three stages: The first, to 2030, targets 400 MW of electrolysis 
and 20 ktpa of renewable hydrogen. The second, to 2045, focuses on network 
development. The third focuses on new production pathways. 

South Africa 
(update) 
Strategy first published in 2022 approved by the cabinet. Targets include 
1 Mtpa of renewable hydrogen (13 GW of electrolysis) by 2030, increasing to 
4 Mtpa (41 GW of electrolysis) by 2050. Exports are expected to account for 
50% by 2050. Focuses on use of domestic resources (platinum) for 1 GW/yr 
of proton exchange membrane (PEM) manufacturing capacity. Total 
investment needs of USD 300 billion by 2050.  
Notes: See Explanatory notes annex for the use of the term “clean” hydrogen in this report. 
 
Notably, ASEAN member countries have progressed with strategies and targets 
since the release of GHR 2023. While there are several ongoing projects in the region 
(see Chapters 2-4), only Singapore had a hydrogen strategy at the time of our last 
edition. Since then, Indonesia, Malaysia and Viet Nam have also published national 
hydrogen strategies. All three have decarbonisation as a key driver and an export-
oriented nature, and use a phased approach with different time horizons, each with 
different areas of focus and objectives. Although the strategies differ in their level of 
detail, all have the overarching aim of identifying enablers for hydrogen development. 
In addition, several more European countries joined the list of those with hydrogen 
strategies, including Bulgaria, Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania and Romania. Their 
strategies largely focus on renewable hydrogen, with Estonia, Lithuania and Romania having set explicit targets.
 
Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 169  
Ireland’s strategy does not set specific targets, but rather 
assesses potential demand, and highlights the country’s offshore wind potential. 
Industry and transport are common end-uses across strategies, with Romania also 
including targets for the power sector. Lithuania’s national strategy for energy 
independence defines hydrogen targets, including 1.3 GW of electrolysis by 2030 
and 8.5 GW by 2050 (to produce more than 730 ktpa). Croatia published an 
implementation plan for its hydrogen strategy, identifying regulatory gaps and priority 
activities to 2030. In Italy, the National Energy and Climate Plan foresees domestic 
consumption of renewable hydrogen of 250 ktpa by 2030, of which 70% is produced 
domestically, requiring 3 GW of electrolysis. Portugal has revised its electrolyser 
capacity target to 3 GW by 2030 (from 5.5 GW) in its public consultation of the 
national and energy climate plan and in August 2024 Greece revised its target from 
1.7 GW by 2030 (set in 2023) to 187 MW. Germany published its hydrogen import 
strategy in July 2024. It expects the import share to be 50-70% in 2030. The strategy 
follows a diversification approach for supply (partners), infrastructure (carriers) and 
products (hydrogen derivatives). Germany is also expected to publish its hydrogen 
storage policy in 2024. 
In China, several provinces announced plans and targets for hydrogen production 
and road transport, including incentive measures to be used (see Box 6.1). There are 
few incentives at the national level (other than technology promotion), and financial 
incentives are set by the provinces. 
Elsewhere, countries with longer-standing hydrogen strategies turned their attention 
to updates. In December 2023, France issued a document for consultation on their 
strategy update. This confirms funding of EUR 9 billion (USD 10 billion), of which 
EUR 4 billion is envisioned for CfD. On the supply side, the focus is on electrolytic 
hydrogen, with electrolyser targets of 6.5 GW by 2030 and 10 GW by 2035. The main 
policy instrument considered for supply is CfD, with annual tenders expected to be 
launched in 2024 that will support a total electrolyser capacity of 1 GW by 2026. 
The proposed update also includes undertaking a study to map and assess the 
economic potential of natural hydrogen by 2025, and a domestic manufacturing 
incentive that is also available for equipment exports. With regards to infrastructure, 
the proposal includes the development of major hubs (e.g. Dunkirk), 500 km of 
transmission pipes, HRS every 200 km (to comply with the EU Alternative Fuels 
Infrastructure Regulation), salt cavern storage, and assessment of imports. Similarly, 
Chile published a new document that provides more detailed actions for each of the 
action areas identified in its existing hydrogen strategy, with the aim of enabling more 
concrete progress towards accelerating hydrogen development in the country. 
Austria published a progress report on the implementation of its 2022 hydrogen 
strategy, in line with its biennial update cycle, and also published a SAF roadmap 
covering scenarios and 15 actions for the short term to promote SAF ramp-up. 
 
The 2020 draft had a target of 0.7 Mt/yr. 
With additions of 150 MW in 2024, 250 MW in 2025 and 600 MW in 2026.

Canada published a progress report covering the project pipeline, incentive schemes, 
deployment, hubs, priorities, and a comparison of scenarios for hydrogen demand to 
2050. India published a document confirming its 2030 targets, and providing an 
overview of the progress so far and the financial incentives in each state, as well as 
the financing options available. 
Box 6.1 
Provincial hydrogen targets in China 
China produced 28 Mt H2 in 2023 – nearly 30% of the global total. Almost 60% of 
the hydrogen was produced from unabated coal and a quarter from unabated gas, 
together emitting about 400 Mt CO2. At the same time, China has been leading 
global hydrogen deployment across electrolysis, synthetic fuels, industry and road 
transport (see Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand and Chapter 3. Hydrogen production). 
In March 2022, China published its national Hydrogen Industry Development Plan, 
with targets for 100-200 ktpa production and deployment of 50 000 fuel cell electric 
vehicles (FCEVs) by 2025. Since then, Chinese provinces have published more 
ambitious plans, with targets adding up to 1 200 kt H2, nearly 120 000 FCEV and 
more than 1 500 HRS by 2025. In 2024, electrolytic hydrogen production from 
projects that are operational, have reached a final investment decision (FID) or are 
under construction could total 165 ktpa (see Chapter 3. Hydrogen production), 
surpassing the national target and reaching almost 15% of the total from provincial 
targets. At the end of 2023, the FCEV stock stood at 20 600 (see Chapter 2. 
Hydrogen demand), 50% up from 2022. A similar pace of growth would be needed 
to meet the national FCEV target by 2025, but 2024 data indicates that growth has 
slowed significantly. As a result, Anhui province has revised its 2025 FCEV target 
from 3 000 to 2 000. Similarly, HRS deployment remains far behind the provincial 
targets, standing at over 400 HRS at the end of 2023. 
The incentive for provinces to achieve their targets is a financial reward from the 
central government (for example, USD 109 million was awarded for the first phase 
of FCEV pilot programmes). Incentives offered by provinces include CAPEX 
subsidies for HRS (e.g. up to USD 280 000 in Tangshan, Hebei), OPEX subsidies 
for HRS (USD 2.8/kg H2 for HRS that sell hydrogen below USD 4.2/kg H2), a price 
cap on the hydrogen for FCEV (e.g. USD 4.2kg H2 in Hebei), as well as supply-
side subsidies such as on OPEX for hydrogen production (e.g. USD 1.4/kg H2 in 
Zhangye, Gansu) and lower electricity prices (e.g. a reduction of USD 21-28/MWh 
in Chengdu, Sichuan) as well as CAPEX support for electrolysis (e.g. 30% CAPEX 
in Shenyang, Liaoning). 
Inner Mongolia is the region with the most ambitious low-emissions hydrogen 
production target: 2.5-5 times the national target and equal to more than one-third 
of the current hydrogen production in the province. Its plans, released in early 
2022, target production of 1.6 Mt by 2025, with a 30% share of renewable 
hydrogen. In early 2023, regional authorities had approved 31 “green” hydrogen 
projects,* but the development rights for 12 of these, with a total electrolysis capacity of more than 3 GW, were later revoked.

* See Explanatory notes annex for the use of the term “green” hydrogen in this report.

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 171  
Some of the incentives in place 
allow for the establishment of hydrogen projects outside the designated chemical 
industrial zones, and have limited requirements for licences in addition to subsidies 
for production and HRS. Among the projects that are already operating or under 
construction are a 90 kt project close to Ulanqab that started construction in July 
2024, and the first phase of the Chifeng city project from Envision, which started 
operations in 2023 with the next phase of more than 56 kt to start in 2024. Two 8-
10 kt projects started operations in March 2024 and July 2024.

Elsewhere, Jilin and Hainan have launched initiatives to promote renewable 
methanol, and Shanghai has set an objective to develop a low-emissions port, 
recognising methanol as a potential pathway. This is also aligned with the Action 
Plan for Green Development of Shipbuilding Industry (2024-2030), released in 
December 2023 by the central government, which focuses on research and pilot 
projects for hydrogen, ammonia and methanol ships. Shandong targets at least 2 
vessels with fuel cells by 2025 and more than 30 by 2030. 
Qinghai is leveraging its industrial base and has identified 43 renewable hydrogen 
and chemical projects integrating 50 kt of ammonia production, 90 kt of urea, 
120 kt of nitrate molten salts, and 50 kt of methanol. Guangxi is pursuing a broad 
approach, including demonstration of hydrogen production from offshore wind, 
biomass and nuclear energy; hydrogen blending at the transmission level; fuel cell 
trucks and ships; and hydrogen for industrial boilers.

Demand creation 
A total of 26 different policies targeting demand creation have been announced since 
the publication of GHR 2023 (Table 6.2). The most common policy instrument used 
is CAPEX support in the form of grants, although India’s policy, which establishes 
quotas, and Germany’s, which will use carbon contracts for difference (CCfD), are 
notable exceptions. Public procurement (e.g. for steel) has not been explicitly used 
to trigger hydrogen demand over the past year. Across all the demand-creation 
policies, applications are most commonly located within hydrogen valleys or hubs. 
Among the policies that list specific target sectors, industrial uses are most common, 
while four countries – Germany, Japan, Korea and Singapore – have announced 
support for the power sector. The aviation and shipping sectors are notably absent, 
despite hydrogen derivatives being essential to decarbonisation in these sectors in 
the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) – representing 2% and 9% 
of final energy consumption, respectively, by 2030. Nearly all the funding envisaged 
by these policies comes from developed countries, though India is an exception, with 
USD 24 million for hydrogen hubs. However, half of the policies and almost 60% of 
the total public funding is only at the announcement stage and yet to be converted 
into a binding law. 
The United States approved almost USD 1.7 billion for six hydrogen-related projects 
as part of the Industrial Demonstration programme. The projects include two 
hydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) plants, a furnace in an ethylene plant that will use 
up to 95% hydrogen, a synthetic ethylene plant, a synthetic methanol plant, and a 
syngas production plant from liquid by-products. Construction should begin by 
October 2026, and up to 50% of the project costs can be covered by the grant. 
Overall, the entire programme (which also covers areas other than hydrogen) has 
announced public funding of USD 6 billion and is expected to mobilise over 
USD 20 billion of private capital investment. Of the USD 6 billion in public funding, 
USD 5.5 billion will come from the IRA, while the remaining USD 0.5 billion comes 
from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  
In a separate effort, the US Department of Energy (DoE) announced the winners of 
the H2Hubs call in October 2023. Seven hubs were selected for negotiation. Once 
negotiation has been completed, funding will be allocated progressively across four 
phases with 8-12.5 years to full capacity. Three hubs have already received total 
funding of USD 87.5 million for the first phase (detailed planning). The public funds 
allocated amount to USD 7 billion, which is expected to trigger a total investment of 
almost USD 50 billion. The DoE also announced the H2DI consortium that will 
design and implement demand-side support mechanisms in order to facilitate 
purchases of hydrogen produced by the H2Hubs, with the aim of helping to provide offtake certainty and unlock FID.
 
Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2), the California Hydrogen Hub (ARCHES) and the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen 
Hub (ARCH2). 

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 173  
The measures and implementation plan should be 
ready by the end of 2024. Separately, the DoE also announced USD 98 million for 
HRS and research facilities. 
In Europe, Spain has included renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) 
among the fuels eligible to be used towards meeting renewable targets in the 
transport sector from 2025 onwards. RFNBO will benefit from having a multiplier of 
two in comparison to biofuels, and fuels delivered to aircraft and ships will be worth 
1.2 times as much as road transport fuels. 
Elsewhere, Japan has released more information on its proposed hydrogen and 
ammonia clusters support scheme to support demand creation in the industry sector. 
The scope of this support includes infrastructure (storage and transport facilities), and 
covers different phases of project development, from feasibility studies to 
infrastructure development. Targets include three large-scale clusters around 
metropolitan areas, and five medium-scale clusters in regional locations. Assets need 
to have a planned operation of at least 10 years, and operation should start before 
2030. 
India launched a tender for hydrogen hubs in August 2024. Up to INR 1 billion (USD 
12 million) of public support will be given to each hub. The target is to have at least 
two hydrogen hubs of 100 ktpa each. Projects must reach completion before April 
2026. Australia launched a consultation paper in June 2024 on policies to promote 
the uptake of low-carbon liquid fuels. Policy instruments under consideration for the 
demand side include mandates, low-carbon fuel standards and targets, and for the 
supply side, CfD, grants and production tax incentives. 
The demand envisaged by demand-side policies and targets remains behind 
production targets (Figure 6.3). Demand for low-emissions hydrogen from policies 
already in force adds up to more than 6 Mtpa by 2030. The European Union leads 
the way on the basis of mandates introduced by the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU 
Maritime regulations. At the sectoral level, refining has the largest share of demand, 
led by China, Canada, and India, where – despite the absence of specific policies – 
the committed projects in the pipeline drive demand. Looking forward, on the basis 
of announced government targets, demand could almost double to reach nearly 
10.5 Mtpa by 2030, with half of this growth coming from the transport sector. 
However, targets for demand are far lower than targets for production, where the 
United States and India alone represent 15 Mtpa by 2030 (10 Mtpa and 5 Mtpa, 
respectively).

Notes: Values reflect all the policies announced at time of writing. “Demand policies in force” represents the maximum of the 
capacity from committed projects in the pipeline and the legislated policies. The dashed area in production targets represents 
policy targets’ ranges. For countries that do not have a production target, the low-emissions hydrogen production target is 
estimated from the capacity targets, assuming a capacity factor of 57% and an energy efficiency of 69% for electrolysers.  
Meeting government targets could create demand for up to 10.5 Mtpa low-emissions hydrogen 
in 2030, far less than the 35-43 Mtpa foreseen by government production targets.

Mitigation of investment risks 
A total of 16 new policies using direct grants have been announced since 
GHR 2023, adding up to almost USD 18 billion. All these funds come from 
advanced economies (mostly Europe), except for USD 109 million from China. 
Almost 70% of these funds are not allocated to a specific call or law. 
In contrast, 7 of the 11 countries that have introduced tax benefits for hydrogen 
technologies are EMDEs. One advantage of this policy measure is that the effect 
on the fiscal budget is lower revenue rather than additional cost. This can be 
especially beneficial in EMDEs, which have a higher cost of capital and have to 
pay an additional premium for extraordinary disbursements.  
In addition, as a reflection of the growing interest in industrial strategies, the past 
year has also seen a rise in policies targeting electrolyser manufacturing. Nine 
countries have now announced such policies, covering up to 60% of the total 
costs, and – in some cases – introducing local content requirements. 
Grants 
Most of the public funding for grants announced in the last year came from the 
European Union through the Important Projects of Common European Interest 
(IPCEI) and the national Recovery and Resilience Plans (RRP), which were part 
of the COVID-19 recovery programme (NextGenerationEU). At the EU level, two 
new rounds of IPCEI have been announced since the publication of GHR 2023, 
with a total public funding of USD 9 billion unlocking USD 9.4 billion of private 
capital. At the level of EU member states, Germany and Spain gave funding 
notices to specific projects from the IPCEI rounds, while Finland, Italy, Poland and 
Spain announced funding through RRP. 
The Dutch Government has allocated EUR 1 billion (USD 1.1 billion) to 
electrolysis in 2024, to cover up to 80% of the investment cost and provide OPEX 
support (up to EUR 9/kg) for up to 10 years, supporting at least 200 MW of 
electrolysis. EUR 3.9 billion (USD 4.2 billion) are reserved for renewable 
hydrogen in subsequent years. This is part of the EUR 9 billion (USD 9.8 billion) 
that has been reserved for renewable hydrogen from the Climate Fund. The Dutch 
Government also awarded EUR 250 million (USD 271 million) of grants to seven 
renewable hydrogen projects that add up to a total electrolysis capacity of over 
100 MW. The average subsidy for the winning projects was EUR 2 500/kWel 
(USD 2 711/kWel). The total request for subsidies amounted to EUR 600 million 
(USD 651 million), and the projects will have to finish construction by 2028. 
 
Considering that the maximum size for the application was 50 MWel. 

Chapter 6. Policies

Competitive bidding schemes 
Several competitive bidding schemes have been announced and carried out in the 
past year. These span a more diverse range of countries than grants, and include 
auctions for ammonia and refining in India, approval of contracts to award land to 
projects worth USD 11 billion in Oman, and auctions opened globally under the 
H2Global scheme. They have helped build experience in the countries concerned 
and supported initial steps towards market creation through transparency and 
price discovery. Given the diversity of auction design, of market and power 
regulation, and of economic conditions, the bid price premiums have varied widely, 
from USD 0.16/kg H2 to USD 1.2/kg H2. 
H2Global launched the first (pilot) auction for renewable ammonia, renewable 
methanol and synthetic kerosene in December 2022, with total funding of 
EUR 900 million (USD 976 million) provided by Germany. The results of the 
auction for renewable ammonia were announced in July 2024. The winner was a 
100 MW project in Egypt powered by 273 MW of onshore wind and solar, and the 
ammonia produced will be delivered to the Port of Rotterdam. The guaranteed 
minimum offtake is for 2027-2033 (240 kt), and the total product price was over 
EUR 1 000/t (USD 1 084/t). The project relies on existing infrastructure, 
preventing the need for additional permitting and enabling lower costs. No winners 
were selected for the synthetic kerosene auction, and its funding will be allocated 
to the renewable methanol auction, though no winners have been announced at 
the time of writing. Preparations for launching new auctions are underway for 
Canada (with a funding commitment of CAD 300 million (Canadian dollars) 
[USD 220 million] from Canada to be matched by EUR 200 million [USD 217 
million] from Germany), with the aim to launch the tender by the end of 2024. 
Auctions are also being planned for Australia (total funds of EUR 400 million 
[USD 434 million] are under discussion), Germany (with EUR 3.53 billion 
[USD 3.8 billion]), the Netherlands (with EUR 300 million [USD 325 million] for a 
joint window with Germany) and for the United Arab Emirates. The H2Global 
Foundation is also working on a report on auction design to inform policy makers 
on how to shape auctions to attain diverse goals. 
The European Union announced the winners of the first auction of the Hydrogen 
Bank (Box 6.2) and approved the third round of IPCEI (Hy2Infra), which will 
support up to 3.2 GW of electrolyser capacity and 2 700 km of pipelines, at least 
370 GWh of storage capacity, and port handling capacity for liquid organic 
hydrogen carrier (LOHC) to handle 6 kt of hydrogen-equivalent per year. The 
European Union also selected 42 projects for EUR 424 million (USD 460 million) 
of grant support under the fifth and final selection of the first Alternative Fuels 
Infrastructure Facility call. A total EUR 115 million (USD 125 million) of this 
funding went to 43 HRS across 7 countries. The first call granted a total of 
EUR 1.3 billion [USD 1.4 billion] (for both electricity and hydrogen) supporting the development of 202 HRS in 2022-2023.

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 180  
The second call opened in February 2024 
with a total budget of EUR 1 billion [USD 1.1 billion] (for both electricity and 
hydrogen), and will be open until the end of 2025. 
Denmark awarded DKK 1.25 billion (Danish kroner) (USD 182 million) to 
6 projects for a total electrolyser capacity of 280 MW. Winning bids had price 
premiums between DKK 9.3/GJ (USD 0.16/kg H2) to DKK 67.5/GJ (USD 1.2/kg H2), which are relatively low. Some possible reasons for this are 
lower power purchase agreement (PPA) prices in Denmark in comparison to other 
European countries, strategic bidding with risk taking, and a low retention penalty. 
The auction was oversubscribed more than three times, with total funding 
requested of DKK 4 billion (USD 5 million) and a total capacity of 675 MW. After 
conclusion of the contracts, the projects will have 4 years to build the construction 
plants. 
In its auction scheme for renewable hydrogen, India has two separate bidding 
processes, known as “modes”. Mode 1 is for a 3-year period, and is open to 
exports. Mode 2 has specific volumes of hydrogen and ammonia, to be used only 
for domestic consumption, with contracts to be signed for 10 years. The total 
budget available for hydrogen production (across all modes) is INR 130 billion 
(USD 1.6 billion). For Mode 1, the total bid capacity from the first round was 
551.7 ktpa from 13 bids against an auction target of 450 ktpa, with a final capacity 
awarded of 410 ktpa. 
The incentive provided is equivalent to USD 0.23-0.42/kg H2. Most of the winners plan to export the hydrogen produced 
rather than using it to meet domestic demand. The second round was launched in 
July 2024 for 450 ktpa, with the same subsidy caps as the first round 
(USD 0.6/kg H2 the first year, decreasing to USD 0.36/kg H2 in the third year). For 
Mode 2, the first round has been launched for 200 ktpa of hydrogen and 750 ktpa 
of ammonia, with the same 3-year subsidy and caps.  
Contracts for difference 
Japan passed the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act, which includes 15-year CfD 
subsidies for domestic and imported hydrogen production as a supply-side 
instrument that complements the clusters support scheme for demand. The total 
funds available are JPY 3 trillion (USD 19.7 billion), which will come from Climate 
Transition Bonds. The programme is open to different technology pathways, as 
long as the “low-carbon” hydrogen81 threshold is satisfied (70% reduction 
compared to fossil-based production, which is equivalent to 3.4 kg CO2eq/kg H2). 
The scheme includes hydrogen and ammonia, with the respective reference 
commodities of liquefied natural gas and coal. Operation must start before 2030 
and continue for at least 10 years once the 15-year period has expired. The strike price is set based on levelised cost of production (including a profit margin), and 
the exact price is set at a project level.
 
See Explanatory notes annex for the use of the term “low-carbon” hydrogen in this report. 

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 181  
The scheme is also open to subsidy 
stacking, so export projects could benefit from subsidies in the country of origin 
and this CfD scheme. Public consultation on the scheme design was open until 
September 2024 and a first tender (using a share of the total funds) is expected 
by the end of 2024. 
In the United Kingdom, the 11 winning projects of the first Hydrogen Allocation 
Round (HAR1) have now been announced. Projects will receive GBP 2 billion 
(USD 2.5 billion) of OPEX support through 15-year contracts, and GBP 90 million 
(USD 114 million) of CAPEX support, subject to the successful signing of the 
contracts with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (the counterparty for the 
hydrogen production support contracts). This is expected to trigger 
GBP 413 million (USD 525 million) of private capital investment between 2024 
and 2026. The total electrolysis capacity is 125 MW, with a weighted average 
strike price of GBP 241/MWh (USD 10.2/kg H2), and first production is expected 
18-24 months after signing the contracts. The total capacity from bids was 
262 MW in comparison to a government target of 250 MW. The government is 
planning to award contracts to the winning projects by the end of 2024. The 
second HAR round was also launched in 2023, aiming to support a capacity of 
875 MW and achieve the ambition of having 1 GW of electrolysis capacity under 
construction or in operation by the end of 2025. 
Tax incentives 
Several tax incentives have been introduced since GHR 2023, predominantly in 
EMDEs. Incentives range from tax refunds to deductions and exemptions. Most of 
the policies (except for in Australia and Brazil) do not introduce caps on the total 
budget allocated to the specific measure, and in most there is no public 
quantification of the effects and cost competitiveness. 
Australia has proposed an AUD 2/kg H2 (USD 1.3/kg H2) production tax incentive 
(similar to the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit under the US IRA), available 
from 2027 for up to 10 years, for facilities starting operation by 2030. The total 
funds are uncapped, but the estimated budget is AUD 6.7 billion (USD 4.4 billion) 
for 2024 to 2034. The incentive can be used for domestic use and exports, and it 
also includes ammonia and methanol. Only hydrogen with less than 
0.6 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 (well-to-gate) is eligible. The consultation paper explicitly 
mentions that additionality and hourly matching are not necessary to qualify for 
the tax incentive. In parallel, the budget of the Headstart programme, which aims 
to bridge the cost gap for first movers using a CfD, has been extended to 
AUD 4 billion (USD 2.6 billion) in total (over 2023-2039). The first round of funding 
for AUD 2 billion (USD 1.3 billion) for a 10-year period from 2027-28 was open for 
expressions of interest in October 2023, with six applicants, adding up to 3.5 GW of electrolysis, shortlisted in December 2023.

These two hydrogen initiatives are 
part of a broader programme, Future Made in Australia, aimed at enabling 
investment in clean technologies and reaping the benefits of a transition to clean 
energy. 
Other policy instruments 
Other policy instruments included land allocation for renewable hydrogen (Egypt, 
Morocco, Oman), hydrogen coverage and rules for issuing certificates under 
carbon pricing schemes (China, European Commission), financing instruments 
(Chile, Japan) and relaxation of local content rules for equipment supply (India). 
One risk to investment that has largely not yet been covered by any policy relates 
to infrastructure and the need for co-ordination between supply, intermediate 
infrastructure (pipelines, storage, ports and terminals), and end use (including 
local transport). Delays in one part of the supply chain – which may be related to 
the novel character of some of these steps – could affect other stakeholders 
across the supply chain. One example of a policy initiative targeting infrastructure 
for end use is The Canada Infrastructure Bank-approved CAD 337 million 
(USD 248 million) loan to construct 20 HRS in British Columbia and Alberta, of 
which 14 will enable the refuelling of 300 heavy-duty vehicles. 
Box 6.2 
First auction of the EU Hydrogen Bank 
The European Union awarded EUR 721 million (USD 780 million) to seven 
renewable hydrogen projects (five of them in the Iberian Peninsula) in the first 
auction of the European Hydrogen Bank. There were a total of 132 bids, adding 
up to 8.5 GW of electrolysis capacity, and nearly 8.8 Mt of production volume over 
10 years, and an oversubscription of 15 times the budget available. Two-thirds of 
the projects were planning to use domestically manufactured electrolysers (or a 
mix of domestic production and imports), and over 60% were targeting industry as 
the end-use sector. The winning projects add up to a total electrolyser capacity of 
1.5 GW, producing nearly 1.6 Mt of hydrogen over 10 years. When annualised, 
this would be equivalent to almost 4% of the EU Hydrogen Strategy target of 
40 GW by 2030. The winning bids will receive fixed incentives of 
EUR 0.37-0.48/kg H2, in comparison to a levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of 
EUR 5.3-13.5/kg H2, and a ceiling price of the auction of EUR 4.5/kg H2. Potential 
reasons for the low bids are lower LCOH in the countries with awards, strategic 
bidding due to competition across the European Union rather than in a single 
country, and higher offtake prices for frontrunners in the downstream uses. The 
individual grant agreements, in which the winners will commit to developing the 
projects, are expected to be signed by November 2024, with entry into operation within 5 years.

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 183  
The draft terms and conditions for the next round were also 
published in April 2024. The budget available for the second round is 
EUR 1.2 billion (USD 1.3 billion). The main changes include a ceiling price of 
EUR 3.5/kg, a maximum period of 3 years to enter operation, and a dedicated 
budgetary basket for the maritime sector. The “auction-as-a-service” scheme* was 
also used by Germany, which allocated an additional EUR 350 million 
(USD 380 million) for projects that met the eligibility criteria but did not benefit from 
EU-level support. Austria has also announced the allocation of EUR 820 million 
(USD 890 million) of funds for auctions for renewable hydrogen. EUR 400 million 
(USD 434 million) will be open for bids before the end of 2024, and could use the 
auction-as-a-service scheme in the second funding round. 
*This model simplifies the auction process by using a standardised design for all member states and the same tender 
process to enable the funding of additional projects

Industrial policies to support domestic manufacturing of 
hydrogen technologies 
The United States announced USD 750 million for 52 hydrogen projects across 
24 states. Over 40% of the funding was for electrolyser manufacturing and 20% 
for fuel cell manufacturing. This budget is part of the USD 1.5 billion available 
under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for R&D and manufacturing. The DoE also 
allocated USD 1.9 billion to 35 clean technology manufacturing projects under the 
Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) of the IRA. This included 
USD 337 million for demonstration of advanced manufacturing processes that can 
decrease costs and increase capacity. Almost one-third of the funding was 
awarded for solid oxide electrolysers (SOEC) to Topsoe and direct CO2 
electrolysis in PEM was also included. The Internal Revenue Service issued a 
second round of the 48C programme with the concept paper submission expected 
in mid-2024. 
In Europe, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom have announced 
or put in place specific policies for clean technology manufacturing – including for 
hydrogen production. In the European Union, the Net Zero Industry Act sets a 
target of domestic manufacturing capacity of at least 40% of the annual 
deployment needs in 2030. Electrolyser manufacturers can tap into the general 
broader funding opportunities such as the Temporary Crisis and Transition 
Framework, which can fund 15-35% of investment costs, the Innovation Fund, 
IPCEI (as already funded through Hy2Tech), and Horizon Europe for novel 
manufacturing processes. 
India has allocated a total of INR 44 billion (USD 0.5 billion) for the FY2025-
2030 period for electrolyser manufacturing. In 2023, the government published 
the results of its first auction for electrolyser manufacturing, with a total 
auctioned capacity of 1.5 GW/yr, with 20% of domestically developed stack 
technology. It received 21 bids for a total capacity of 3.3 GW/yr. There were 
eight winning companies, with three of them awarded funding for 0.3 GW/yr 
each. In early 2024, India launched a call for the second tranche, for another 
1.5 GW/yr, with the winners announced in August. In this second tranche, 23 
companies bid for a total capacity of over 2.5 GW/yr, with 13 of those 
companies receiving support. The incentive is for 5 years, decreasing from 
INR 4 440/kW (USD 53/kW) in the first year to INR 1 480/kW (USD 18/kW) in the last year.
 
This represents about 20% of the INR 197 billion (USD 2.4 billion) budget (until 2030) of the National Green Hydrogen 
Mission. 

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 189  
There is also a local value addition criterion, increasing from 40% 
in the first year of production to 80% by the fifth year.

Promotion of RD&D, innovation and 
knowledge-sharing 
Government investment in RD&D in hydrogen technologies remained robust in 
2023, exceeding the historical record of 2022 by almost 5% (Figure 6.4). In the 
past 5 years alone, RD&D spending on hydrogen technologies has nearly 
quadrupled – increasing faster than spending on other clean technologies – to 
reach a share of more than 9% of total clean energy RD&D spending. To put this 
growth into perspective, the first phase of Mission Innovation targeted a doubling 
of clean energy RD&D spending over a period of 5 years (across all clean 
technologies, which is more difficult to achieve given the larger baseline). For its 
second phase, Mission Innovation did not set a specific target, but rather 
recognises the need to increase clean energy RD&D spending to USD 90 billion 
by 2026, which represents far less ambitious growth than the earlier target of 
doubling spending. 
Figure 6.4 Government RD&D spending on hydrogen technologies by region, 2018-
2023 
Note: Data includes IEA member countries and Brazil. 
Public budgets for RD&D on hydrogen technologies remained robust in 2023, even 
exceeding the record spending of 2022 by almost 5%. 
Two-thirds of the RD&D funding come from Europe. At the EU level, the Clean 
Hydrogen Partnership has an average funding of EUR 170 million/yr 
(USD 181 million/yr) for 2021-2027, complemented by national funding, which is 
led by Germany and France. In the United States, the budget has also increased rapidly from just USD 150 million in 2020-2021 to USD 430 million in FY2023.
 
The IEA has collected data on energy RD&D spending in member countries since 2004. Data on RD&D spending in Brazil 
has been collected since 2013. 

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 191  
While advanced economies contribute the most to global RD&D funding, there are 
also examples from EMDEs, which can help these economies to develop domestic 
capabilities and leverage their rich renewable resources. Notably, India launched 
several calls to demonstrate hydrogen use in steel, trucks, buses and shipping. 
Governments are also committing funding to ensuring that communication and 
knowledge-sharing from low-emissions hydrogen RD&D projects is effective and 
transparent. For instance, the Australian Government funds both the 
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation HyResearch web

International co-operation 
Over the past few years, international co-operation on hydrogen has had a strong 
focus on bilateral efforts, but more recently there has been an increase in 
multilateral co-operation. In particular, COP 28 resulted in numerous hydrogen-
related outcomes: 
 The International Hydrogen Trade Forum (an initiative that was launched at a G20 
meeting in India in 2023 under the umbrella of the Clean Energy Ministerial 
Hydrogen Initiative [H2I]), signed a partnership agreement with the Hydrogen 
Council. The agreement includes prioritisation of actions, progress monitoring, 
analysis of emerging cross-border trade corridors, knowledge-sharing of best 
practices, and an annual Ministerial-CEO roundtable as a platform for continued 
dialogue to accelerate cross-border trade and maximise socio-economic benefits. 
 A set of international organisations (IPHE, IEA H2 TCP, UNIDO, IRENA, and 
UNECE), brought together under the Breakthrough Agenda, agreed to work on implementing a multi-year programme to develop and secure agreement on 
international standards, certification and related processes.
 
IPHE = International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy; TCP = Technology Collaboration 
Programme; UNIDO = United Nations Industrial Development Organization; IRENA = International Renewable Energy 
Agency; UNECE = United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. 

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 193  
 The H2I and the Rocky Mountain Institute agreed to jointly co-ordinate a working 
group of international initiatives under the Breakthrough Agenda umbrella to 
increase uptake of renewable and/or low-emissions hydrogen in priority 
applications, mitigate financial risks, develop international standards and 
certification, and connect supply and demand including cross-border trade. 
 A total of 30 shipping sector leaders signed a Call to Action to increase maritime 
fuels derived from renewable hydrogen to nearly 11 million tonnes by 2030. 
Further COP 28 outcomes relating to hydrogen certification and standards are 
explored in more detail below. 
Hydrogen has also gained attention in the G7 and G20 fora. Brazil’s G20 
Presidency has defined one of its priorities for the Energy Transitions Working 
Group as innovative perspectives on sustainable fuels – including hydrogen and 
biofuels. One of the expected outcomes for this year is a roadmap with policy 
guidelines for accelerating market development for new sustainable fuels, 
including hydrogen and its derivatives. In the case of the G7, in their 2024 
Communiqué, the Climate, Energy and Environment Ministers committed to 
promote and facilitate the scale-up of investments in the industrial sector for 
innovative technologies, including low-emissions hydrogen and its derivatives, 
and to strengthen co-operation on low-emissions hydrogen as a key factor of the 
energy transition for EMDEs, prioritising local energy access and development 
needs. 
UNIDO is implementing two funding schemes, the Green Climate Fund Readiness 
Programme and Global Environment Facility - Global Clean Hydrogen 
Programme. These are expected to support the development of clean hydrogen 
clusters and to help countries with the process of developing enabling policies, 
improving technical readiness, knowledge management, building capabilities for 
standards and developing financial mechanisms for the successful uptake of clean 
hydrogen. Most of the activities under these schemes will start in 2025. 
The IEA H2 TCP and the Clean Hydrogen Mission of Mission Innovation have 
announced the development of a global research and innovation agenda which 
will aim to inform governments about priority areas for promoting research and 
innovation in hydrogen technologies. This initiative could significantly advance the 
alignment of R&D agendas, particularly for end-use hydrogen technologies. 
Furthermore, these two initiatives started a joint study on the future demand of 
hydrogen in industry (Task 48). 

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 194  
Certification, standards, regulations 
Standards, certification and regulation on the 
environmental attributes of hydrogen 
Certification (see Box 6.3) is essential to providing evidence on the contribution of 
low-emissions hydrogen deployment to GHG emissions reduction. Moreover, it is 
crucial to the development of hydrogen trade, given that traded hydrogen and its 
derivatives cross borders, potentially moving across regions with different 
accounting systems. The last few years have seen rapid progress, with several 
countries moving from proposing certification schemes, to specifying the rules, 
criteria and labels. Some have already incorporated these rules into law. However, 
with the plethora of schemes in place (see Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen 
and its derivatives), there is a risk of incompatibility and additional administrative 
burden as hydrogen is globally traded. The IEA has emphasised the importance 
of mutual recognition between national certification schemes as one of the key 
action areas for policy makers, as have other organisations (e.g. IPHE, UNIDO, 
IRENA), underlining the importance of harmonising schemes and GHG 
accounting methodologies. Several of these efforts are brought together under the 
umbrella of the Breakthrough Agenda, which has made developing and 
implementing common standards for the GHG emissions of hydrogen production 
one of its priority areas, as well as safety, standards and certification. 
Box 6.3 
Key terminology related to certification  
There are several terms related to certification that refer to different concepts, but 
which are often used interchangeably. In this section, these terms are used as 
follows: 
Certification refers to the process of assessing whether a product complies with a 
given set of criteria. These may be mandatory requirements, in order to 
demonstrate compliance with legislation (e.g. the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in 
the United States), or eligibility for incentives (e.g. the Green Hydrogen Standard 
in India). Alternatively, they can be voluntary, such as reporting progress towards 
defined targets (e.g. the Climate Bonds Initiative) following disclosure guidelines. 
Certificates can carry information about the origin of the energy used for 
production, as well as the time and location. This is usually intended to create 
transparency for customers. Information disclosed may be limited to the origin of 
the energy (in which case the certificate is called a “guarantee of origin”), or broader environmental attributes such as land or water use (in which case it is called a “sustainability certificate”).
 
The Breakthrough Agenda was launched at COP 26, and currently with 59 government signatories and 39 specifically for 
the hydrogen sector. 

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 195  
An example is the EU Renewable Energy 
Directive (RED), which requires disclosure of the origin of the energy (Article 19) 
and aspects relating to broader environmental impact (Articles 29 and 30) leading 
to the emergence of schemes to verify compliance with each of these 
requirements. 
Chain of custody is the name given to the process associated with the change of 
ownership of the certificates and correspondence between the certificate and the 
certified product. In a book and claim model, the certificate is completely 
separated from the product and can be traded independently. In a mass 
balancing model, both are directly linked. 
A certification scheme encompasses the governance, application, evaluation, 
enforcement and verification of certificates. This includes the stakeholders (e.g. 
the issuing body) and their roles, registry and processes. In some cases, legislation 
comes first, followed by the establishment of certification schemes that in turn 
enable project developers to access incentives associated with legislation. For 
example, the production tax credit in the United States has set GHG thresholds 
that projects must comply with in order to access tax incentives, but there is 
currently no certification scheme to verify compliance, and final guidelines are still 
being defined. In contrast, the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification 
scheme for synthetic fuels was in place before the EU RED legislation was 
finalised, and the issuing body is now seeking recognition for the scheme from the 
European Commission as a way for projects to demonstrate compliance towards 
RED targets (as are the bodies behind other schemes). 
A labelling scheme can be used to document that a product or production route 
has satisfied a defined set of criteria established by the certification process, such 
as labels that communicate the emissions intensity of hydrogen production. For 
example, the “green” hydrogen standard* in India is a label that can be applied to 
hydrogen meeting a threshold of 2 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. 
A technical standard defines a formalised and shared methodology to be used to 
assess certain criteria defined by the certification scheme. This can include 
boundaries, product specifications, GHG accounting rules, and other aspects. The 
ISO Technical Specification is one example. 
Elsewhere in this report, the term “certification” may be used to encompass several 
of the above aspects in order to facilitate understanding. 
* See Explanatory notes annex for the use of the term “green” hydrogen in this report. 
 
Important progress towards harmonisation and alignment was achieved at 
COP 28, with the launch of the Technical Specification for the methodology for 
determining the GHG emissions associated with the production and transport of hydrogen (ISO/TS 19870:2023).

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 196  
This was based on the methodology proposed 
by the IPHE and will be used as the basis for a multi-part series covering the 
hydrogen supply chain from production to consumption gate. The international 
standard for hydrogen production should be finalised in 2025, and the standards 
for GHG emissions from ammonia, LOHC, and liquid hydrogen in 2026. In 
addition, at COP 28, a Declaration of Intent for the mutual recognition of 
certification schemes for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and hydrogen 
derivatives was signed by 37 governments. This effort is intended to drive 
convergence towards a minimum set of fundamental design principles for 
certification schemes, and to prevent a potential fragmentation that could delay 
the emergence of a global market, as well as increasing investor confidence. 
Signatories commit to seek accelerated technical solutions to enable mutual 
recognition of the schemes, including co-operation through the IPHE and the IEA 
H2 TCP, and the adoption of globally recognised standards such as the 
forthcoming ISO methodology. 
In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service released the proposed rules to 
accompany the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (45V) in December 2023. 
The rules specify how to determine the lifecycle GHG emissions from hydrogen 
production and the conditions the electricity input needs to satisfy to produce what 
can be categorised as “clean” hydrogen. GHG emissions should be estimated 
using the 45VH2-GREET tool, using a well-to-gate approach (i.e. including 
upstream emissions and without emissions from construction). Energy attribute 
certificates can be used to document the use of renewable electricity for 
electrolysis, and requirements for incrementality, temporal matching and 
deliverability must be fulfilled. These requirements are well aligned with those set 
in the European Union, with a maximum 36-month period between the operation 
of the renewable electricity input and the electrolyser beginning operations 
(incrementality), annual correlation between the renewable electricity and the 
hydrogen production until 2028 (when hourly correlation will become necessary 
[temporal matching]), and the same bidding zone for the renewable facilities and 
the electrolyser (deliverability). Furthermore, in June 2024, the Internal Revenue 
Service finalised rules for wage and apprenticeship requirements that can further 
increase the credit from USD 0.6/kg H2 to USD 3/kg H2. Guidelines for the tax 
credit itself are still to be finalised. 
In the European Union, the RED Amendment entered into force on November 
2023, and member states have until May 2025 to transpose it into national 
legislation. In addition, in May 2024, the European Council adopted the Hydrogen 
and Decarbonised Gas Package, which defines low-carbon hydrogen as needing 
to meet a 70% GHG reduction in comparison to the fossil fuel benchmark (94 g CO2-eq/MJ).
 
See Explanatory notes annex regarding the use of the term “clean” hydrogen in this report. 

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 197  
Details on the specific conditions, methodology to quantify 
GHG emissions and criteria are deferred to a Delegated Act that should be 
published within 12 months of the package entering into force (i.e. by June 2025). 
The European Union and Japan also announced intentions to co-operate to 
promote renewable and low-carbon hydrogen globally and ensure that standards 
and regulation converge. 
Meanwhile, Denmark recognised the scheme from International Sustainability and 
Carbon Certification for the certification of renewable hydrogen. This was done as 
a temporary measure to avoid delays in project development while waiting for the 
list of recognised schemes by the European Commission.  
Germany and France transposed the EU Delegated Acts for RFNBO into national 
legislation. In Germany, the updated regulation introduces a system for providing 
evidence of compliance with the requirements for the production and delivery of 
liquid and gaseous RFNBO. The certification of suppliers follows a similar process 
to the existing Biofuel Sustainability Ordinance. 
In Spain, from 2025, hydrogen and its derivatives will count towards reaching the 
target of 29% of renewable energy in transport set in the revised EU RED. The 
same Ministerial Order that introduced this policy also modifies the guarantees of 
origin scheme for renewable gases to include sustainability criteria and CO2 
emissions reduction data, as well as requirements to account for the renewable 
electricity used in hydrogen derivatives. 
In Portugal, the electricity and gas grid operator (REN) started issuing guarantees 
of origin (GoO) for renewable hydrogen in July 2024. This will be harmonised with 
the schemes in other EU member states by the end of 2024, which will enable 
these GoO to be used with imports and exports within the European Union. 
The United Kingdom published an updated version of the Low Carbon Hydrogen 
Standard in December 2023. Updates include a refinement of key requirements 
for electrolysers, including a definition of eligible PPA, renewable energy GoO 
requirements, calculation of transmission and distribution losses, requirements for 
electricity storage systems, the addition of methane pyrolysis, and updated 
methodologies. This standard defines the criteria for projects to be able to apply 
for the Hydrogen Production Business Model (OPEX) support while the 
government is working on a Low Carbon Hydrogen Certification Scheme, which 
should be published by 2025. 
In China, guidelines released in October 2023 for GHG reporting for industrial 
assets could give an indication of future guidance for hydrogen. Off-grid non-fossil 
electricity is considered to have zero emissions, while emissions from non-fossil 
fuel electricity are calculated using the national grid emission factor from 2022 set 
at 570 g CO2/kWh, and “green certificates” cannot be used for emission offsets. 
 
Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 198  
Japan has proposed GHG thresholds under the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act. 
Thresholds include 3.4 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for hydrogen (well-to-gate), 
0.87 kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 for ammonia (well-to-gate), 49.3 g CO2-eq/MJ for 
synthetic methane (well-to-point of consumption) and 39.9 g CO2-eq/MJ synthetic 
fuels (well-to-point of consumption). The CO2 source should be biogenic, from 
direct air capture, or should be covered by agreements to avoid double counting 
of emissions (e.g. allocating the emissions to the original emitter). These rules are 
yet to be finalised. 
In Latin America, 14 governments reached an agreement to work on a common 
certification scheme known as “CertHiLAC” for clean and low-carbon hydrogen. 
This initiative is receiving support from the Inter-American Development Bank and 
the Latin American Energy Organization. A group comprising national 
representatives was formed to establish a governance structure for the 
agreement, define relevant stakeholders, and issue recommendations. In Peru, a 
law was published defining “green” hydrogen as hydrogen produced using 
technologies with low GHG emissions. The law also makes the Ministry of Mines 
and Energy responsible for defining the criteria for certifying the GoO of the green 
hydrogen. In Brazil, the government has finalised the rules of the Brazilian 
Hydrogen Certification Scheme (SBCH2), including definitions and a governance 
structure. The rules set a GHG threshold of 7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 to define low-
carbon hydrogen, but additionality criteria for the renewable electricity was not 
included following its rejection by the Senate. Further details, such as on chain of 
custody, scope, criteria and instruments, will be defined in subsequent legislation. 
The scheme will be voluntary for producers, and the need for international 
collaboration and harmonisation of standards is also emphasised. The operator of 
the electricity market (CCEE) has manuals on governance, methodology and 
criteria for the certification of hydrogen and derivatives, and used these to certify 
two projects in 2023. Only electrolysis is included in the CCEE scheme. With 
regards to scope and criteria, the scheme covers both on- and off-grid 
configurations, includes indirect emissions from electricity, and requires more than 
90% renewables, emissions lower than 18 g CO2/MJ, and a PPA with additionality, 
a monthly correlation and geographical correlation. 
Elsewhere, Kenya issued guidelines for the sustainability criteria for “green” 
hydrogen and derivatives. Sustainability is defined in terms of electricity source, 
water, land and local communities. Guidelines on health and safety, project 
registration, local content, incentives, commencement date, transition and 
complaints handling are also provided. The renewable hydrogen production must 
have well-to-gate lifecycle emissions of less than 1 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 and 0.3 kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 in the case of ammonia, averaged over a 12-month period.
 
Three sourcing options are considered: (1) captive renewable supply; (2) grid connection with at least 80% renewable 
supply in a calendar year and with an average grid emission intensity below 64.8 g CO2/kWh during the previous calendar 
year; and (3) Supply from a remote renewable plant by using PPA and renewable energy certificates. 
 
Chapter 6. Policies

Qualitative targets are defined for most criteria, except for the GHG thresholds 
and the criteria for the electricity input. 
In Australia, consultation on the scheme design and the emissions accounting 
approach to be used was undertaken prior to October 2023, and final legislation 
introducing a GoO scheme should be in place by July 2025. Australia is also 
considering extending the GoO scheme to cover the production of low-carbon 
liquid fuels (including synthetic fuels) and it has allocated AUD 18.5 million 
(USD 12.2 million) from the federal budget 2024-2025 to this initiative over the 
next 4 years. 
The United Arab Emirates is working on developing a low-carbon certification 
scheme through the Hydrogen Taskforce as a follow-up to its hydrogen strategy. 
The certificates are expected to be voluntarily tradeable and to carry energy, 
environmental, and social attributes. 
Among the new strategies published in the last year, Indonesia’s strategy notably 
defines a certification scheme as a critical component of a clear regulatory 
framework to promote hydrogen deployment. 
Operational and safety standards  
In 2024, the ISO Technical Committee 197 published two new standards: (ISO 
19880-9:2024) on sampling for fuel quality analysis at HRS and (ISO 19885-
1:2024) on fuelling protocols of gaseous hydrogen for passenger vehicles. There 
are 21 standards published so far and 26 under development, of which the majority 
are related to fuelling stations, fuelling protocols and vehicle fuelling system 
components. Ten standards have now reached the status of Draft International 
Standards and one has reached the Final Draft International Standard stage. 
In addition, the International Electrotechnical Commission has published 34 
standards so far (including 6 since the publication of GHR 2023) relating to the 
safety of fuel cell modules, performance test methods, and micro fuel cell power 
systems.  
The IPHE performed a gap assessment of regulations, codes and standards 
(RCS) for large-scale storage of hydrogen to identify the critical areas for research 
and regulation to enable the large-scale deployment of bulk hydrogen storage. 
The report mapped the RCS in nine countries for above-ground and underground 
tanks, and for subsurface storage. Common gaps across countries included 
maximum storage sizes that are insufficient for the large-scale storage needs foreseen for the future and setback distances that must be reviewed.
 
IEC 62282-2-100:2020/COR1:2023; IEC 62282-4-202:2023; IEC 62282-6-101:2024; IEC 62282-6-106:2024; IEC 62282-6-107:2024; IEC

Importantly, in some cases hydrogen was either absent from the regulations or fell under the 
scope of different legislations. 
In November 2023, UNIDO organised the ISO Hydrogen Technologies Plenary 
Week, which convened over 150 global experts representing 62 countries, 
including 34 EMDEs, and is now supporting the development of a framework for 
quality infrastructure along the renewable hydrogen supply chain. This will include 
a practical guide for the use of the ISO methodology by industry and government 
stakeholders. The guide will be used for capacity-building activities expected to 
begin in the second half of 2024. 
At a regional level, in 2024, the United States is focusing on identifying and 
addressing permitting challenges, understanding and addressing indirect impacts 
of hydrogen releases, materials compatibility, and the advancement of sensor 
technologies (through R&D). The United States already has a tool to help projects 
navigate relevant codes and standards. Canada will complete a Codes and 
Standards roadmap in 2024, identifying and prioritising any gaps to be resolved to 
support hydrogen development. 
In the European Union, an RCS Strategy Coordination Task Force will be set up 
in 2024, composed of the European Commission, the Clean Hydrogen Alliance, 
and Hydrogen Europe. The Task Force aims to enhance European engagement 
with international RCS bodies, and to support the Commission in working on 
standardisation with IPHE and the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM). A report on 
international RCS developments is planned for publication by the end of 2024. 
At the national level, in July 2024 Germany launched a strategic roadmap for the 
expansion and adaptation of the technical regulations for hydrogen technologies. 
In the Netherlands, the safety standards for ammonia storage and loading are now 
being revised in phases, and the final version of the first phase, applicable to new 
facilities, was published in July 2024. In the United Kingdom, the government aims 
to work with industry in 2024 to ensure the regulatory framework is fit for purpose 
for hydrogen along the value chain. 
In other regions, Australia is developing national hydrogen codes of best practice 
for hydrogen and ammonia production and appliances, which will cover hydrogen 
production, refuelling and storage safety. These codes aim to provide clarity on 
the regulatory obligations for projects, the regulators involved in the different steps 
of the process, and timing and cost of compliance. Co-design workshops between 
government and industry were held in late 2023, with public consultation expected 
to take place in 2024. The government maintains lists of the regulations and 
standards that each part of the value chain should comply with. In April 2024, 
New Zealand launched a public consultation to adopt 13 hydrogen-related ISO 
technical standards. 

Chapter 6. Policies

Regulations on infrastructure, permitting and other areas 
In the European Union, the Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Package was 
adopted in May 2024, after the Commission first proposed it in December 2021. 
This defines the governance of the hydrogen transmission network in the 
European Union, noting that a 10-year development plan will be published every 
2 years starting from 2026, and setting a maximum of 2% (by volume) hydrogen 
blend for cross-border gas infrastructure in case member states cannot come to 
an agreement. Member states have until mid-2026 to transpose the new rules into 
national law. 
Germany passed regulatory frameworks for hydrogen network development and 
its financing. The network is to be financed by the private sector, with fees that are 
capped to avoid high initial costs that could prevent market development. The fees 
have a deferral scheme, in which fees in the early years will be lower than the 
actual costs to promote market ramp-up. To ensure liquidity, there are extra 
payments from the government to ensure a pre-tax nominal return on equity of 
6.69%. The European Commission approved EUR 3 billion (USD 3.3 billion) of 
German state aid to be provided as a government guarantee and will allow 
transmission system operators to obtain more favourable loans. The German 
Government also presented the draft Hydrogen Acceleration Act, which aims to 
digitalise, simplify and prioritise planning, approval and procurement procedures. 
This includes setting maximum deadlines for approval procedures, shortening 
appeal processes, and reducing administration. It will cover hydrogen production, 
pipelines, port terminals, ammonia cracking, and power lines supplying 
electrolysers. Elsewhere, in Denmark, the government reached an agreement on 
the economic framework conditions for hydrogen infrastructure and the 
principles and conditions for state risk hedging. Spain granted a provisional 
authorisation to Enagas (the gas transmission system operator) to develop 
hydrogen networks recognised under the European Projects of Common Interest. 
The United Kingdom announced support in principle for a hydrogen core network 
following the recommendation of the National Infrastructure Commission. The 
government published a strategic planning document in December 2023, and 
plans to open a consultation in 2024 for specific activities, with the system operator 
formally becoming responsible for network planning from 2026. A Regulated Asset 
Base emerged as preferred financing model of the network in the public 
consultation, with a revenue floor for 15 years for storage assets. Given the current 
lack of overarching regulation for the network, the government has extended the 
existing offshore oil and gas pipeline and storage regulatory frameworks to cover 
offshore hydrogen pipelines and storage. In parallel, a market consultation for the first allocation rounds of the transport and storage business models was launched in December 2023.
 
Including regulated third-party access, no tariff exemption for individual (types of) users, and 10% of network capacity 
reserved for short-term contracts. 

Chapter 6. Policies 
PAGE | 202  
The government also announced its support for blending up 
to 20% hydrogen (by volume) in the gas distribution network in certain scenarios 
and circumstances. A position on blending in the transmission network is expected 
in 2024, and before a decision is taken, the HyDeploy industry trials will provide 
further evidence. There will be a safety review, and a report assessing economic 
support will be prepared. The government also launched the Track-1 expansion 
process of HyNet in December 2023 for a CO2 storage capacity of 
1.3-1.5 Mtpa CO2 from 2028 (in which hydrogen is one of several relevant 
sectors), contributing to the 20-30 Mtpa CO2 target for 2030. Winners will be 
announced in Q3 2024, with FID expected by 2026, and latest operating date by 
the end of 2030. 
Elsewhere, in March 2024, Australia finalised a process of extending the national 
gas law and regulations to include hydrogen with the amendment of the National 
Gas Rules and the National Energy Retail Law. Israel granted a permit to allow 
the natural gas transmission operator to engage in the transportation of hydrogen 
and CO2.

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 203  
Highlights 
 In 2023, global hydrogen production emitted 920 Mt CO2. Nearly two-thirds of 
production was from unabated natural gas, which emits 10-12 kg CO2-
equivalent (CO2-eq)/kg H2; about 20% was from unabated coal, which emits 22-
26 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. Between 75% and 95% of these emissions occur directly 
at the point of production, and can be reduced by carbon capture, utilisation and 
storage (CCUS). For hydrogen from steam methane reforming (natural gas), 
abatement costs are estimated at around USD 60-85/t CO2 for capture rates of 
55-70%, and USD 85-110/t CO2 for rates above 90%. However, carbon capture 
alone is not sufficient; upstream and midstream emissions must also be tackled.  
 Hydrogen from electrolysers is emissions-free at the point of production, and so 
emissions depend on the electricity used. Emissions intensity from electricity 
generation should be below 200-240 g CO2/kWh for emissions to be lower than 
steam methane reforming. Renewable electricity is emissions-free at the point 
of generation, but embedded emissions can occur in the construction and 
manufacturing of renewable assets. Such emissions are currently not included 
in most standards and schemes; they can range from 0.4-2.7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. 
 The process of converting hydrogen to a carrier for transport incurs energy 
losses of 45-70%. This means that any GHG emissions from the electricity input 
to the electrolysers increases by a factor of 2-3 in terms of the final hydrogen 
delivered. The lowest emissions are achieved when the electrolyser uses 
renewable electricity, and the hydrogen transported is used as shipping fuel and 
no fossil fuels are used in hydrogen recovery. Liquid hydrogen results in the 
lowest emissions due to its higher pathway efficiency (above 50%); emissions 
are slightly higher for liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) and ammonia. 
 The emissions reduction offered by carbon-containing hydrogen-based fuels is 
greatest when the CO2 source is biogenic or from the air. The emissions 
intensity of their electricity input should be lower than 160-190 g CO2-eq/kWh 
for synthetic methanol and 95-140 g CO2-eq/kWh for synthetic methane and 
kerosene to result in lower emissions compared to a fossil fuel. In emissions 
accounting, the way CO2 emitted during fuel combustion is allocated along 
processing steps in the supply chain has a large effect on the total emissions 
allocated to the individual product.

Overview 
In 2023, global production of 97 Mt of hydrogen emitted nearly 920 Mt CO2 (Chapter 
3. Hydrogen production). This is equivalent to the annual energy-related emissions 
of Indonesia and France combined. In the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario 
(NZE Scenario), these emissions must go down by around 10% to 820 Mt CO2/yr by 
2030. At the same time, in this scenario total hydrogen production needs to increase 
by over 50% to 150 Mtpa, which means that the reduction required in terms of specific 
emissions is more significant than in absolute terms, with a 40% drop needed by 2030 
to reach ~5.5 kg CO2/kg H2. 
A hydrogen molecule does not contain any carbon, which means the CO2 emissions 
do not come from the end use, but rather from the production, processing and 
transport of hydrogen. Carbon accounting must therefore track the CO2 emissions at 
each conversion step in the supply chain. The framework used to account for and 
report on GHG emissions is of critical importance for the trade of low-emissions 
hydrogen, especially as traded hydrogen may cross borders and jurisdictions, and 
the majority of the GHG emissions occur upstream in the supply chain, during 
production and transportation. 
A large number of certification schemes and regulations (see Box 6.3 for clarifications 
on certification-related terminology) have emerged in the past 3 years (see Figure 
7.1), using different boundaries, production routes, definitions, emissions thresholds 
and methodologies for varying products. Nevertheless, there have been signs of 
convergence in the past year. The publication of the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) Technical Specification for the hydrogen supply chain from 
production to consumption gate will set the basis for the ISO standards to be 
published in the next 2 years. At the multilateral level, the COP 28 Declaration of 
Intent on mutual recognition of certification schemes, and regional efforts in Latin 
America for a common certification scheme (CertHiLAC) demonstrate strong 
commitment to establishing common standards. The IEA H2 Technology 
Collaboration Programme (TCP) Task 47 and the International Partnership for 
Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE) Hydrogen Certification Mechanisms 
(H2CM) Task Force are two global initiatives that have joined efforts to develop an 
evidence base on the current certification mechanisms and to support building 
consensus and mutual recognition across schemes. These efforts must continue in 
order to ensure that accounting is carried out based on a common methodology for 
tracking lifecycle emissions as hydrogen crosses borders. 
Existing certification schemes currently use a wide range of emission thresholds and 
labels (Figure 7.1). More than half of the schemes require an emissions intensity lower than 4 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2, which is 60-70% lower than the 10-12 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2 from unabated natural gas, the most common production route today.
  
Considering 0 kg CO2/kg H2 for hydrogen produced as a by-product in naphtha crackers and steam crackers. Considering a 
maximum of 10 kg CO2/kg H2 emissions would increase up to 1 070 Mt CO2. This includes direct emissions from hydrogen 
production and close to 300 Mt of CO2 utilised in the synthesis of urea and methanol, the majority of which is later emitted. This 
excludes upstream and midstream emissions for fossil fuel supply 

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 205  
Of the schemes that allow higher thresholds, six are part of a programme aiming to reduce 
CO₂ emissions in road transport, where the lower conversion efficiency of internal 
combustion engines (in comparison to fuel cells) means higher emissions from 
hydrogen production and transport could still lead to a net emissions benefit 
(comparing hydrogen use with the incumbent fossil fuel), which explains the use of 
higher thresholds. Another scheme with a threshold higher than 4 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2 is 
used in China, where nearly 60% of hydrogen is produced from unabated coal, which 
can have emissions of 22-26 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2. Brazil has recently passed legislation 
approving an emissions threshold of 7 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2, more than double the 
threshold in the European Union, and 3.5 times the threshold of India. At the lower 
end, Australia has proposed a threshold of only 0.6 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2 for its Hydrogen 
Production Tax Incentive (HPTI), which aims to promote the development of 
renewable hydrogen and should be in place by July 2027. In addition to hard limits, 
several countries apply schemes with tier systems to define several emissions 
thresholds, which are associated with progressive financial incentives for producers 
with lower emissions. 
All schemes (except for in the European Union, the UK Renewable Transport Fuel 
Obligation and H2Global) that have a threshold below 4 kg CO₂-eq/kgH2 are well-to-
gate in their scope. Hydrogen that is traded globally will have higher specific 
emissions due to transport and conversion, which means that well-to-wheel schemes 
that have the same threshold as well-to-gate schemes pose more stringent 
requirements for hydrogen producers, as transport and distribution emissions are 
also included. 
Only two schemes cover hydrogen-based fuels exclusively. One is from H2Global, 
which is a programme started by the German government aimed at imports. The 
programme covers well-to-point of delivery and its threshold is similar to others at 
3 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2. The other is a voluntary scheme by the Ammonia Energy 
Association, originally proposed in 2021 and currently under development. In total, 
ten schemes (of which five are regulatory) cover both hydrogen and its derivatives. 
Seven (three regulatory) of these are already operational. European schemes do not 
define a specific production route, and only specify a GHG threshold that any 
hydrogen (or derivative) should achieve, as well as the methodology to be used. 
Ammonia is most common among schemes that explicitly mention the carriers. Steel 
is exclusively mentioned in the (voluntary) Zero Carbon Certification Scheme.

System boundaries and scope of emissions 
This report uses the boundaries and methodology of the ISO Technical Specification 
(Figure 7.2), which may eventually be used as a common basis for future regional 
and national methodologies. The supply chain steps covered in the specification are hydrogen production, conditioning, conversion to hydrogen carriers, transport, and reconversion to hydrogen.

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 207  
Emissions associated with the electricity input and 
upstream and midstream methane emissions are included. Emissions from 
construction, manufacturing, and decommissioning of assets are excluded from the 
scope, but their quantification should be provided separately for information. With a 
well-to-gate scope, only the end use is excluded. 
The ISO Technical Specification currently covers hydrogen carriers that are expected 
to be reconverted back to gaseous hydrogen (liquefied hydrogen, LOHC and 
ammonia), including cases where they are used directly (as for ammonia). Carbon-
containing synthetic fuels such as methane, methanol and other hydrocarbons are 
excluded from the scope. These can be used directly as fuels due to their higher 
volumetric energy density (compared to pure hydrogen carriers) and existing 
infrastructure that facilitates transportation to the end use. 
Global warming potential (GWP) (which covers GHG emissions) is one of several 
categories typically covered in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis. The rest of 
this chapter will focus only on GHG emissions, but the total environmental impact of 
hydrogen must be assessed considering criteria across all the impact categories. 
Beyond the environmental aspect, other dimensions such as social aspects or cost 
can necessitate trade-offs when designing a plant or making a final investment 
decision on a project, but these factors are not included in this analysis. 
Supply chain efficiency is defined in this report as the energy finally delivered as 
hydrogen compared to the total energy input along the supply chain. As a result, 
design changes, like the use of hydrogen that has been transported to provide the 
heat for ammonia cracking and LOHC dehydrogenation, or as a shipping fuel, will 
decrease the efficiency (and increase the specific GHG emissions), since this 
hydrogen consumption along the chain reduces the hydrogen finally delivered.

and sea.

Emissions intensities of hydrogen production 
routes 
This chapter updates previous IEA analysis on emissions intensities of hydrogen 
production routes. The updates introduced here are consistent with the ISO Technical 
Specification, and based on updated data on upstream and midstream methane 
emissions from 2022, and updated technical parameters for some of the conversion 
processes. This section focuses on hydrogen production, meaning that the scope is 
well-to-gate. 
For production pathways using natural gas and coal without carbon capture and 
storage (CCS), direct emissions during hydrogen production represent as much as 
75-95% of the total emissions. Hydrogen produced from natural gas emits 

For the analysis in this chapter, only carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been considered, since the ISO Technical 
Specification does not consider carbon capture and use (CCU) among the included hydrogen production routes. 

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 209  
10-12 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, with the range coming from the difference in upstream and 
midstream GHG emissions (Figure 7.3). Emissions from hydrogen production from 
coal are higher, at 22-26 kg CO2-eq/kg H2.  
CCS can be used to reduce the direct emissions, with the capture rate and abatement 
cost depending on the technology pathway and the point of capture. Capture rates 
for steam methane reforming (SMR) are the lowest (55-70%) when carried out only 
in the concentrated stream on the process side, which also results in the lowest 
abatement cost (USD 60-85/t CO2). When capture is also implemented on the flue 
gas, which is more diluted and has lower pressure, the capture rate can increase 
above 90%, but the cost also increases to USD 85-110/t CO2. Process modelling 
studies have shown that plant capture rates of 96% and up to 99% can be technically 
and economically feasible. Using electricity instead of natural gas to achieve the high 
temperatures needed for reforming is also an option, but this would tackle only the 
emissions from fuel combustion, which are around 45% of the total, and therefore 
mitigation of the emissions from the process side would still be required. For 
autothermal reforming, capture rates can be 93-98% since most of the CO2 is on the 
process side at high pressure. The gas partial oxidation (POx) process developed by 
Shell is reported to yield overall plant capture rates up to 99%, although these high 
capture rates are yet to be proven in large-scale commercial plants on a continuous 
basis.  
Once CCS is implemented, the upstream and midstream GHG emissions become 
the dominant factor, accounting for up to 98% of the total emissions when partial 
oxidation of natural gas with 99% capture is applied. Upstream and midstream GHG 
emissions can make up to 90% of the total for production from coal (when a 98% 
capture rate is applied), due to higher residual emissions from carbon capture. 
For production using natural gas, the global average upstream and midstream 
emission intensity in 2022 was 11.3 kg CO2-eq/GJNG, which corresponds to 20% of 
the CO2 produced during the combustion of the natural gas, and is equivalent to about 
1.8 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. These emissions alone would be four times higher than the 
lowest threshold defined in the production tax credit in the United States (0.45 kg CO2-
eq/kg H2) and 60% of the threshold defined in the EU Taxonomy. There is a wide 
spectrum of natural gas emissions intensity around the world. At the lower bound, 
Norway has an upstream and midstream emissions intensity of 4.5 kg CO2-eq/GJNG 
(0.7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2), compared to up to 27 kg CO2-eq/GJNG (4.3 kg CO2-eq/kg H2) 
for Turkmenistan. The solutions to mitigate upstream and midstream emissions are known and cost-effective.
  
This includes CO2 and methane emissions occurring during the production, transport and processing of the fuels. 
For merchant plants, i.e. where hydrogen production is not integrated with a specific process. 
If not specified otherwise, energy amounts are based on lower heating values. 
Assuming an efficiency of 75%. This could increase to 3.8 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 if a 20-year time horizon is used for the global 
warming potential instead of 100 years. 

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 210
In the NZE Scenario, the global average upstream and 
midstream emissions intensity of natural gas would be halved by 2030. 
Reliable methane emissions inventories are critical to establish baselines, define 
targets and track progress. National emission inventories are known to underestimate 
these emissions, but other efforts in recent years have made progress in closing this 
gap. Clear and standardised measurement, monitoring, reporting and verification 
(MMRV) guidelines are also essential to ensure the interpretation of the emissions 
measured. For example, in 2020 the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) launched the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (its flagship oil and gas 
reporting and mitigation programme), which has developed guidance for methane 
measurement. The EU Methane Regulation introduces mandatory MMRV 
requirements on domestic producers and establishes a transparency platform with 
country profiles (including non-EU member states exporting to the European Union). 
There are also government efforts aiming to measure and reduce these emissions 
like the Global Methane Pledge, which is supported by countries covering 50% of 
global anthropogenic emissions and targets 30% reduction by 2030 (compared with 
2020). In November 2023, the US Department of Energy (DoE) announced an 
international working group, composed of 14 members, to establish an MMRV 
framework for providing comparable and reliable information to natural gas market 
participants. 
For production using coal, upstream and midstream emissions can make even a 
larger difference. Even with a capture rate of 98%, the upper end of upstream and 
midstream emissions would result in total emissions from hydrogen production above 
5 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 (for coal), which is more than half the most common 
conventional production route today (from natural gas) and above most low-carbon 
thresholds that have been defined in certification schemes (see Chapter 6. Policies). 
For hydrogen production using water electrolysis, emissions are largely defined by 
the electricity input. Due to the conversion efficiency of the electrolysis process, every 
100 g CO2/kWh associated with electricity supply results in nearly 5 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 
in hydrogen production. This means that the emissions intensity of the electricity 
input needs to be lower than 200-240 g CO2/kWh to breakeven with the unabated 
natural gas route. There is a large range around the world: Countries that have a high 
share of hydropower today (e.g. Norway, Paraguay, Switzerland) or nuclear (e.g. 
France) achieve emissions intensity lower than 45 g CO2/kWh, and countries with a 
high share of gas and coal can have grid emissions intensity above 700 g CO2/kWh. 
Nearly 85% of the global electricity production is above this breakeven threshold (on 
an annual average basis), which means that operating an electrolyser with electricity 
from the grid on a continuous basis might not make sense in most countries from an 
environmental perspective. In addition, certifying the use of renewable electricity, and accounting for the CO2 emissions associated with the electricity input, might become more difficult when an electrolyser is connected to the grid, and the additional 
electricity demand could trigger additional fossil-based generation.
 
Assuming an efficiency of 55%. 
Assuming an efficiency of 67%. 

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives

Today, off-grid 
configurations are common among proposed projects, which makes the GHG 
emissions accounting much simpler. At the same time, due to their fast response 
time, electrolysers can provide increased short-term flexibility to the grid, enabling the 
integration of renewables as well as seasonal flexibility when coupled with large-scale 
storage. A hybrid configuration could potentially combine the best of both options, 
using a small share of electricity from the grid (with GHG emissions tracking) to 
provide firm capacity and increase utilisation of the assets, while limiting the GHG 
increase. 
Emissions from construction and manufacturing of all assets (commonly called 
embedded or CAPEX emissions) are excluded from the boundaries defined by the 
ISO Technical Specification to determine the GHG emissions intensity of hydrogen, 
but should be reported for information purposes. For renewables only, they could 
range from 0.4-2.7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. These emissions are expected to decrease 
as technology innovation increases efficiency and capacity factors and decreases 
material intensity, at the same time as the energy used during manufacturing is 
decarbonised. 
Nuclear electricity can be another energy source for electrolytic hydrogen production. 
Although direct emissions from a nuclear power plant are zero, the nuclear fuel cycle 
of uranium mining, conversion, enrichment and fuel fabrication results in emissions 
of 2.4-6.8 g CO2-eq/kWh. On this basis, the emissions intensity of hydrogen 
production from nuclear electricity is in the range of 0.1-0.3 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. 
For hydrogen production from bioenergy, the direct emissions are also considered to 
be zero. Emissions can, however, occur upstream in the bioenergy supply chains, 
and the carbon footprint depends heavily on the origin of the feedstock and the 
processing steps. In the case of using wood chips, these emissions may be 
4-18 kg CO2-eq/GJ, resulting in total emissions of 1.0-4.7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for 
hydrogen from biomass gasification. Combining such a gasification plant with CCS 
and a capture rate of 95% can result in negative emissions of -16 
to -21 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, by effectively removing biogenic carbon from the natural 
carbon cycle. 
 
This is on top of the additional costs for the grid connection and potential delay this can introduce to the project. 
Embedded emissions are 17-53 g CO2-eq/kWh for solar PV and 8-18 g CO2-eq/kWh for onshore wind. For SMR, research 
and project data indicate embedded emissions are in the order of 0.4% of unabated emissions. 
GHG emissions from bioenergy supply can vary widely depending on the scope (land use change), type and processing steps. 
Hydrogen could be produced along with other co-products and negative emissions should be allocated as per ISO standards 
to avoid double counting.

Figure 7.3 
Comparison of the emissions intensity of different hydrogen production 
routes, 2022 
Notes: BAT = best available technology; CCS = carbon capture and storage; SMR = steam methane reforming; POx = partial 
oxidation; Median upstr. emis. = global median value of upstream and midstream emissions in 2022; BAT upstr. emis. = best 
available technology today to address upstream and midstream emissions. Upstream and midstream emissions include CO2 
and methane emissions occurring during the extraction, processing, and supply of fuels (coal, natural gas) or production, 
processing, and transport of biomass. Error bars for natural gas and coal represent the impact of the observed range of 
emissions intensities. For natural gas, the lower bound corresponds to best available technology today (4.5 kg CO2-eq/GJ), and 
the upper bound to the 95% percentile of the world range (18.8 kg CO2-eq/GJ). For coal, the lower bound corresponds to the 
5% percentile (6 kg CO2-eq/GJ) and the upper bound to the 95% percentile (23 kg CO2-eq/GJ) of global upstream and 
midstream emissions of coal supply. Methane emissions are converted to CO2-eq with a GWP over a time horizon of 
100 years. The 2023 world grid average is based on a generation-weighted global average of the grid electricity intensity, with 
the error bars representing the 10% percentile (46 g CO2-eq/kWh) and 90% percentile (702 g CO2-eq/kWh) across countries. 
The grid electricity intensities include direct CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions at the power plants, but not 
upstream and midstream emissions for the fuels used in the power plants. Dashed lines refer to the embedded emissions 
occurring during the production of onshore wind turbines (12 g CO2-eq/kWh) and solar PV systems (33 g CO2-eq/kWh). These 
embedded emissions are not included in the ISO TS methodology, but are part of the mandatory information to report. 
Electrolysis refers to low-temperature water electrolysis with an assumed efficiency of 67% (Lower heating value [LHV]). 
Hydrogen production from natural gas via SMR is based on 44.5 kWh/kg H2 for natural gas in the case of no CO2 capture, on 
45.0 kWh/kg H2 for natural gas in the case of 60% capture rate, and on 49 kWh/kg H2 for natural gas and 0.8 kWh/kg H2 for 
electricity in the case of a 93% capture rate. Hydrogen production from natural gas via POx is based on demands of 
41 kWh/kg H2 for natural gas and 0.7 kWh/kg H2 for electricity in the case of a 99% capture rate. Hydrogen production from coal 
is based on gasification, with demands for coal of 57 kWh/kg H2 and for electricity of 0.6 kWh/kg H2 in the case of no CO2 
capture, demands for coal of 59 kWh/kg H2 for a CO2 capture rate of 93% and demands for coal of 60 kWh/kg H2 for a CO2 
capture rate of 98%. Emissions from electricity demand for CO2 transport and storage are included. 
Direct emissions represent the largest share of total emissions for hydrogen production from 
natural gas and coal, while indirect emissions are the most relevant for electrolysis.

Box 7.1 
Potential impact of hydrogen leakage 
Hydrogen is an indirect greenhouse gas and its release into the atmosphere (e.g. 
due to leakage in production, transport and use processes) can lead to climate 
impacts. There are two main uncertainties regarding hydrogen leakage: the leakage 
rate at different steps of the supply chain, and the GWP of hydrogen once it has 
been released to the atmosphere. 
The main challenge relating to the leakage rate is that most of the data available is 
from modelling, rather than field data obtained for existing operating assets, and is 
largely focused on production. Filling this knowledge gap would require field data or 
experimental data with actual hydrogen leakage measured along the entire supply 
chain. The main approach used for modelling is to take leakage rates from natural 
gas and adjust to hydrogen according to the difference in physical properties. Some 
of the limited experimental analysis indicates that hydrogen leaks at similar rates to 
natural gas. Leakage rates* will also depend on the operational practices of the 
equipment (e.g. venting, purging, boil-off).

Hydrogen has an average atmospheric lifetime of 2 (1.4-2.5) years, which means its 
equivalence over time needs to be calculated to compare it with other GHG and 
calculate its GWP. Hydrogen does not cause global warming by itself, but has an 
indirect effect through three mechanisms: 
 Hydrogen reacts with hydroxyl radicals, which are the main way methane is 
decomposed in the atmosphere. This increases the lifetime of methane. 
 Hydrogen radicals in the troposphere react with oxygen, thereby producing more 
ozone (which has a warming effect). 
 Hydrogen increases water vapour in the stratosphere (which has a warming 
effect).  
There is a fourth mechanism affecting the formation of (sulphate) aerosols, but this 
is relatively weak compared to the others. Hydrogen has not yet been included in 
the IPCC GWP factors, but so far, there have been several fundamental chemistry-
transport models assessing its radiative forcing.

To give a sense of the order of magnitude, if hydrogen were to reach double the 
leakage level of natural gas (which is about 1%), considering that it is a smaller 
molecule, and the annual hydrogen flow increases to about 420 Mt by 2050 in line 
with the NZE Scenario, the hydrogen leakage could be equivalent to about 
100 Mt CO2/yr. This is equivalent to less than 6% of the GHG emissions from gas 
supply in 2022. 
There are efforts underway and planned in the areas of sensor development 
(improving precision and response time) in the Netherlands, Norway, the United States; direct measurements (e.g. a research facility in the United States and efforts co-ordinated by the Environmental Defense Fund); and emissions inventories 
in the Netherlands and the United States.

The US DoE allocated USD 8.6 million in FY2023 to six projects developing and validating sensor technologies for hydrogen losses. 
More research is needed to better understand both key uncertainties and assess the 
most cost-effective ways to deal with hydrogen leakage. Furthermore, standards and 
regulations are needed to manage the reduction of hydrogen leakage and promote 
transparency and accountability. 
*Studies assessing the range of leakage rates by part of the supply chain include CGEP (2022), Cooper et al

Emissions intensities of ammonia production routes 
Ammonia production represents about a third of hydrogen demand today. Global 
production was nearly 180 Mt in 2022, with associated CO2 emissions of 
420 Mt CO2. Today, about 70% of global ammonia production is from natural gas 
with the majority of the remainder being from coal (mainly in China). Direct emissions 
represent more than 80% of the total emissions. Differences in emissions in different 
regions result from differences in emissions intensity of the upstream and midstream 
production and in technology performance (efficiency), with a 25-35% difference 
between the best and worst performers. Ammonia (NH3) is produced by combining 
hydrogen with nitrogen from air, and the bulk of emissions are associated with 
hydrogen production. Since ammonia is a carbon-free molecule, almost all of the 
input carbon can be captured during the production process, and today about 60% of 
the CO2 emissions are typically captured in ammonia plants. Almost none of the 
captured CO2 is permanently stored at present, and about 130 Mt CO2 of the 
captured CO2 emissions are then used for urea, and are re-emitted when fertiliser is 
applied to soils. 
Ammonia production from natural gas has a global average emissions intensity of 
2.1 kg CO2-eq/kg NH3, while use of the best available technology can reduce 
emissions to 1.9 kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 (Figure 7.4). The alternatives to reduce emissions 
are the same as those discussed for hydrogen regarding the upstream emissions, 
with the advantage that carbon capture is already part of the process. The capture 
rate could be increased by targeting the flue gas of the steam boilers, which are the second largest CO2 source, and the CO2 that is not used for urea could be stored 
underground.
 
This includes direct emissions and CO2 used downstream for urea production but excludes upstream and midstream 
emissions for fossil fuel supply.

There are also indirect emissions from electricity used in parts of the 
process, which should also be taken into consideration. 
Coal gasification with CCS is another production route for ammonia. The emissions 
intensity of ammonia production from coal with CCS is in the range of 
0.5-2.0 kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 (again, depending on the upstream and midstream 
emissions for coal and electricity supply and the type of coal). 
CO2 emissions associated with the electricity supply govern overall emissions for the 
electrolytic production pathway. If electricity with global average emissions intensity 
is used, specific emissions would be almost three times those of production with 
unabated gas. 
Figure 7.4 
Comparison of the emissions intensities of different ammonia production routes, 2022 
Notes: CCS = carbon capture and storage. Ammonia production from coal is based on coal gasification, while the natural gas 
route uses steam methane reforming (SMR). Coal with partial capture corresponds to a CO2 capture rate of 52%, while full 
capture results in a 93% capture rate. For natural gas, partial capture corresponds to a 75% capture rate, which is an average 
of the partial capture in an SMR and an autothermal reformer, and full capture to 94%. Error bars reflect the range of upstream 
and midstream emissions for natural gas, coal and biomass supply. The 2023 world grid average is based on a generation-
weighted global average of the grid electricity intensity resulting in 460 g CO2-eq/kWh. Dashed lines refer to the embedded 
emissions occurring during the production of onshore wind turbines (12 g CO2-eq/kWh) and solar PV systems 
(33 g CO2-eq/kWh). These embedded emissions are not included in the ISO TS methodology but are part of the mandatory 
reporting. Electrolysis refers to low-temperature water electrolysis with an assumed efficiency of 67% (LHV). 
Emissions from ammonia production from natural gas can be reduced by nearly 70% by using 
carbon capture with a 94% capture rate. 
Emissions intensities of (re)conversion and 
shipping of hydrogen carriers 
As a gas, hydrogen has a low volumetric energy density, and needs to be converted 
to a form with a higher energy density for transportation over long distances to be 
economically viable. This process requires energy (and generates emissions), first 
for conversion to the hydrogen carrier, then for the transport, and then for reconversion of the carrier into pure, high-pressure hydrogen (see Figure 7.5).

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 217  
The carriers that are most commonly considered to enable hydrogen transport over long 
distances are ammonia, liquefied hydrogen and LOHC. These are also the carriers 
included in the ISO Technical Specification to date. Other hydrogen carriers that may 
become available in the coming years include sodium/potassium borohydride and 
iron oxide powder. Gas pipelines can also be used for transporting hydrogen over 
long distances, with emissions mainly dependent on the emissions intensity of the 
electricity used for compression. 
Figure 7.5 
Hydrogen shipping value chain and design choices affecting GHG emissions 
There are four key design choices to be made across different steps in the value chain for 
shipping hydrogen, and these define the GHG emissions at each step in the process.  
Ammonia 
The GHG emissions associated with use of ammonia as a hydrogen carrier are 
determined by different factors across the supply chain (see Figure 7.6). Different 
cases shown in Table 7.1 demonstrate that individual parameters can change the 
lifecycle emissions. 
The dominant factor in the GHG emissions of ammonia production is the electricity 
input to the electrolyser. These emissions are directly proportional to the share of 
electricity that comes from the grid and the emissions intensity of the grid. Meeting 
only 5% of the electricity input from a grid with an average emissions intensity of 
100 g CO2/kWh would lead to total specific emissions intensity of almost 
0.4 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. Every conversion step leads to energy losses, which means the 
energy efficiency of the supply chain is just about 35%. Therefore, any emissions 
associated with electricity consumption will be increased by a factor of three when 
expressed in terms of the final hydrogen delivered. These emissions alone would be 
almost equivalent to the lowest threshold in the production tax credit (45V) in the 
United States (0.45 kg CO2-eq/kg H2). This introduces a trade-off between economic 
and environmental considerations. From the economic perspective, a small share of 
electricity from the grid can provide a source of firm electricity and reduce the need to oversize renewable assets and energy storage (either as batteries or hydrogen), but it can lead to higher emissions (in cases where the grid electricity is not low-emissions).

Figure 7.6 
GHG emissions intensity for the ammonia supply chain 
Notes: HB = Haber Bosch; HFO = Heavy Fuel Oil; NG = Natural Gas; RES = renewable energy sources. The reference case 
assumes that 5% of the annual electricity consumption of the electrolyser is supplied by the grid and the rest comes from low-
emissions electricity sources; ammonia synthesis uses the same average electricity mix as the electrolyser; the shipping fuel is 
the transported ammonia; and transported hydrogen provides the heat needed for cracking the ammonia. Electricity demand for 
hydrogen compression to 30 bar (from 1 bar) is included in the import site. Electrolyser efficiency of 66% (LHV) is assumed. 
Embedded emissions refer to the construction of renewable assets. Upstream and midstream emissions of natural gas included 
when used as a fuel for ammonia cracking. 
The electricity used for the electrolyser and the synthesis unit, and the fuel used for ammonia 
cracking, are key parameters defining the lifecycle emissions of ammonia. 

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 219  
Efficiency losses along the supply chain can make embedded emissions in this 
pathway larger than all the emissions from onsite hydrogen production. These are 
included in the ISO Technical Specification for information purposes only, but are 
significant (1.3-2.0 kg CO2-eq/kg H2). Besides the electrolyser, the electricity source 
used for the auxiliary equipment also makes a big difference. A compressor is needed 
to go from the operating pressure of the electrolyser (1-40 bar) to the operating 
pressure of the ammonia synthesis (150-250 bar), requiring 0.9-3.8 kWh/kg H2. 
Additionally, the air separation unit consumes another 0.5-2.2 kWh/kg H2. This is an 
order of magnitude lower than the 50-55 kWh/kg H2 consumed by electrolysis, but it 
could result in much higher emissions, given that the compressors are not as flexible 
as the electrolyser and require closer to 24/7 supply. If the compressors operate only 
with electricity from the grid, the resulting emissions are 0.4 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for 
every 100 g CO2-eq/kWh increase in the emissions intensity of the grid. 
In contrast, the emissions intensity of the grid on the importer’s side has a much lower 
influence on the lifecycle emissions. 
Ammonia cracking is favoured thermodynamically at low pressures and hydrogen needs compression before use. 
This results in an additional energy consumption of at least 2 kWh/kg H2 for 
compressing the hydrogen from 1 bar to 30 bar (at the lower end of typical pressures 
used for transport by pipeline) and almost 5 kWh/kg H2 for compression to 700 bar 
(at the higher end of road transport applications).  
Using heavy fuel oil (HFO) as a shipping fuel would result in a specific emissions 
increase of 0.8 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 (for 10 000 km), leading to a net increase of 13% in 
the specific emissions, despite improving the pathway efficiency by 1.5% points (to 
38%). Similarly, the use of natural gas for cracking increases the pathway efficiency 
by 7% points (to 43%) but increases the specific emissions by 2.8 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. 
Therefore, in both cases, the use of the hydrogen and ammonia transported to 
provide the energy requirements of different steps of the supply chain leads to lower 
specific CO2 emissions, despite the lower supply chain efficiency. Cracking could also 
be done with waste heat, but would require heat at at least 500°C. Where waste heat 
is available at this temperature, it is typically utilised locally (either for process heat 
or power generation) and would therefore need to be replaced, potentially generating 
additional emissions. Another option is to use solar thermal (coupled with thermal 
storage), which can achieve temperatures of more than 1 000°C and is not 
associated with GHG emissions, but could require oversizing to compensate for a 
lower number of operating hours. In both of these cases, there would still be some 
emissions from cracking related to the electricity demand. 
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers  
The fundamental difference in emissions intensity for other hydrogen carriers relates to the 
form of energy used and the part of the supply chain that requires this energy (Figure 7.7). 
In the case of LOHCs, the first step is to incorporate the hydrogen into the carrier 
molecule, through a process called hydrogenation, which is exothermic and requires 
limited electricity. Therefore, there is an energy surplus at the exporting side, which in most 
cases is assumed to have low-cost renewable energy. The hydrogen content of LOHCs is relatively low (0.061-0.072 kg H2/kg carrier vs 0.176 kg H2/kg carrier for ammonia), which means a lower amount of hydrogen is transported for the same weight, leading to a higher 
energy consumption per unit of hydrogen transported in shipping. Similarly to ammonia, 
LOHC reconversion (i.e. dehydrogenation) requires a significant amount of energy, 
equivalent to about 35% of the energy contained in the hydrogen molecule.
 
The most common molecules considered are benzene, toluene, dibenzyltoluene, benzyltoluene, but a wider range of 
molecules could be used. 

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives

Figure 7.7 
Energy consumption by hydrogen carrier and step in the value chain (top) 
and pathway efficiency (bottom) 
Notes: LOHC = Liquid organic hydrogen carrier; LH2 = Liquefied hydrogen. Bars with a range start from the lower bound instead of 
the axis. Range of energy consumption captures potential technology improvement to 2050. Values that are expected to change 
less over time are shown as bars starting from the axis. Values are based on large-scale commercial facilities. Distance of 10 000 
km assumed for shipping. Values for LOHC reflect the potential use of different chemical compounds as carriers. Ammonia could 
be directly used in some applications, which would make the reconversion step unnecessary. 
Among hydrogen carriers, ammonia and LOHC require the most energy as heat on the 
importing side, for reconversion, and liquefied hydrogen is the most energy-efficient pathway. 
From a GHG emissions standpoint, the choices to be made about design of the 
supply chain are similar to those for ammonia. Emissions are lower if the transported hydrogen is used as a shipping fuel (through onboard dehydrogenation), and as fuel 
to supply the heat for dehydrogenation at the importing terminal, than if HFO or 
natural gas are used (Figure 7.8).
  
Fuel consumption is proportional to the engine size (power), which is turn proportional to the vessel size in tonnage. In a liquid 
hydrogen carrier, 100% of the shipping fuel is used to transport the hydrogen, while in an LOHC carrier, only 6-7% is used for 
this (the other 93-94% is used to transport the carrier). Furthermore, with LOHC, the carrier needs to be transported back to the 
origin, resulting in additional fuel consumption in comparison to ammonia or liquid hydrogen, which are typically offloaded at the 
import terminal. 

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 221  
The GHG emissions for LOHC would be 0.2 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 at the importing side for compression and dehydrogenation for 
every 100 g CO2/kWh increase in the grid’s emission intensity. The rest of the 
emissions associated with the production route are dominated by the emissions from 
electrolysis, which is not a differentiator between supply chains. In terms of both total 
emissions along the supply chain and in efficiency, ammonia results in similar values 
to LOHC, since the higher electricity consumption for compression at the exporting 
site is compensated by lower emissions associated with hydrogen recovery from the 
carrier at the importing site. Unlike LOHC, ammonia can be directly used in some 
applications, meaning that energy is not needed for reconversion, improving both the 
GHG emissions and the energy efficiency of the pathway. 
Liquid hydrogen 
Hydrogen liquefaction requires significant energy (equivalent to 18-30% of the energy 
contained in the hydrogen), due to its low boiling point (20 K) and associated boil-off 
losses upon storage and transport. However, its main advantage is that this energy 
consumption takes place at the exporting side, which is expected to have abundant 
renewables, meaning low-cost, low-emissions energy should be available. Shipping 
liquefied hydrogen results in energy losses due to boil-off, but has a low energy 
consumption at the import terminal since there is no demand for heat nor need for 
compression. This results in higher supply chain efficiency, which can be 60% 
higher than that of LOHC (Figure 7.7). However, the high energy consumption for 
liquefaction means that the source of electricity is critical. With an electricity demand 
of 6 kWh/kg H2 (mainly for compressors), the emissions from liquefaction are 
0.6 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for every 100 g CO2/kWh increase in the emissions intensity of 
the grid. This electricity could come from renewables, but this would require a stable 
supply, as intermittent operation of a liquefaction unit has not been demonstrated. 
Alternatively, batteries could be used to smooth the electricity input, but would 
increase costs. For shipping, the hydrogen boil-off from stored liquid hydrogen is 
sufficient to meet the energy demand of the ship. If more energy is needed (as in the 
return journey, where the boil-off might not be enough), regasification of additional 
hydrogen from onboard storage is possible with limited additional costs. In 
comparison, use of HFO may not be an attractive option since it would increase 
emissions, energy consumption and costs (due to the need for an onboard re-
liquefaction unit). 
When these factors are taken into account, the supply chain emissions from liquid 
hydrogen could be almost 40% lower than those of ammonia or LOHC for similar reference conditions (Figure 7.8), with a large share of this achieved by the higher 
efficiency (resulting in more final product and lower specific emissions).
 
A liquid hydrogen pump can be used instead of a compressor which has a much lower energy consumption.  
Expected to be the long-term target for liquefaction (currently at 10-12 kWh/kg H2). 
Boil-off rate for commercial vessels is expected to be in the order of 0.1%/day or less.

GHG emissions intensity for liquid organic hydrogen carrier (top) and liquid 
hydrogen (bottom) supply chains 
Notes: HFO = Heavy Fuel Oil; NG = Natural Gas; RES = renewable energy sources; Dehydr. = Dehydrogenation. The same 
set of assumptions and cases are used as in Figure 7.6. “Grid electricity for utilities” assumes that water treatment for 
electrolysis and for hydrogenation require firm electricity supply from the grid (as opposed to from renewables). Heat demand 
for dehydrogenation of 12.2 kWh/kg is assumed. Electricity demand for hydrogen compression to 30 bar (from 1 bar) is 
included in the import site. Electricity demand for hydrogen liquefaction of 10 kWh/kg is assumed. For liquid hydrogen, HFO 
use for shipping and NG for cracking are excluded, since shipping uses the boil-off from the storage tanks and there is no heat 
demand associated with hydrogen regasification. 
For LOHC, the lowest emissions come from using the hydrogen cargo as a fuel for shipping 
and for dehydrogenation, while liquid hydrogen has lower emissions overall if there are low 
CO2 emissions associated with the electricity used.

Emissions intensity of carbon-containing 
hydrogen-based fuels 
Hydrogen is a versatile molecule that can react with multiple compounds and can be 
used either as a fuel or as a chemical feedstock. Hydrogen can also be converted to 
carbon-containing fuels such as methane, methanol or hydrocarbons that can be 
used directly. Given that these fuels emit CO2 upon combustion, the origin of the 
carbon in the fuel is crucial to the overall emissions. If the carbon originates from a 
fossil source, combustion will make a net positive contribution to CO2 emissions, 
and the key question is how to allocate that CO2 across processes in the supply chain. 
If the carbon has a biogenic origin or comes from direct air capture, then the fuel 
combustion does not add to atmospheric carbon, and the key question for carbon 
accounting narrows down to the emissions associated with the conversion steps. 
Figure 7.9 
Specific GHG emissions for carbon-containing hydrogen derivatives as a 
function of CO2 emissions intensity of the electricity input 
Notes: w/ = with; w/o = without. Excludes emissions from construction and manufacturing. Low-temperature direct air capture is 
assumed using a heat pump with a coefficient of performance of 3 using grid electricity. Compression to operating pressure of 
the synthesis unit is included. Synthetic fuel “w/ end use CO2“ means that the CO2 is fossil-based, with CO2 from combustion 
having a positive contribution to emissions, while “w/o end use” means the CO2 is biogenic or from air. Fossil fuel routes include 
average upstream and midstream emissions and emissions from combustion. 
Synthetic fuels need to be produced from electricity with very low emissions intensity in order 
to have lower emissions than their fossil counterparts. 
Conversion to synthetic fuels enables the use of existing distribution infrastructure 
and end-use technologies, but reduces the supply chain efficiency. The energy 
efficiency of the synthesis step varies from 57% for synthetic kerosene to 77% for 
methanation and 86% for methanol synthesis (all exothermic reactions). These efficiency losses translate into lower final product yield, which increases the 
magnitude of GHG emissions upstream in the value chain.
 
This is incompatible with a net zero emissions system since fossil CO2 ends up in the atmosphere. The use of fossil CO2 can 
still result in emissions reduction since the CO2 is used twice potentially halving emissions (in case carbon-free energy is used). 
Kerosene is co-produced with naphtha and diesel, but the text refers to kerosene only for simplicity. This efficiency includes 
the product yield of the hydrocracking unit. 

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 224  
The two choices about supply chain design with the most influence on the GHG 
emissions of carbon-containing hydrogen derivatives are the electricity source and 
the CO2 source. Figure 7.9 shows the influence of the emissions from the electricity 
source. The slope is defined by the supply chain efficiency. Synthetic jet fuel is the 
least efficient, which means every CO2 molecule emitted upon electricity production 
is multiplied by a factor of 2.5-3 when expressed in terms of the energy in the product. 
For synthetic methanol and synthetic methane, while methanol has a higher 
efficiency for the synthesis step, additional energy is required for compression, since 
the synthesis operates at higher pressure than methanation (50-150 bar vs 10-
70 bar), resulting in a similar slope for both pathways. Considering the range of 
upstream and midstream GHG emissions from oil and gas production, synthetic jet 
fuel and methane would equal the emissions of their fossil counterparts when the 
emissions intensity of the electricity input is 95-140 g CO2-eq/kWh. Synthetic jet fuel 
and methane have a similar point of intersection, given that the lower conversion 
efficiency and higher CO2 consumption per MJ of product of jet fuel compared to 
methane is compensated by higher emissions of the fossil fuel reference. For 
methanol, the electricity emissions intensity required to breakeven with the fossil fuel 
reference is higher, at 160-190 g CO2-eq/kWh, due to the higher efficiency and lower 
(than Fischer-Tropsch) CO2 use. These values represent the upper bound and best 
case for synthetic fuels. The breakeven points would be lower if the CO2 source were 
fossil-based with full allocation to the synthetic fuel. In this case, the CO2 emitted 
upon combustion would be the same for both fossil and synthetic routes. As such, for 
the synthetic fuels to have lower emissions than fossil fuels, the emissions associated 
with the CO2 capture, compression and water treatment of electrolysis would need to 
be lower than the upstream emissions from oil and gas. This would shift the 
breakeven points to 5-50 g CO2-eq/kWh for methane and jet fuel, and 
40-70 g CO2-eq/kWh in the case of methanol. The effect on emissions of other design 
choices, such as the technology used to supply the heat for carbon capture, will be 
dependent on the temperature level and heat demand. Heat demand can be nearly 
zero for processes with concentrated CO2 streams, such as ethanol or ethylene 
oxide, going up to 5.3-7.2 GJ/t CO2 for direct air capture. 
Alternatives for the carbon accounting of the CO2 source 
There are two related, but different, key questions for CO2 emissions accounting. The 
first relates to the process of sourcing the CO2, and how the emissions from that 
process are allocated to the CO2 stream that is used for the synthetic fuel alongside 
other products (e.g. electricity) from the same facility. In addition, given that the 
hydrogen-based fuel is combusted, and the CO2 is released to the atmosphere, the second key question concerns how those emissions are allocated among the 
stakeholders of the value chain. 
 
Synthetic fuels are also known as e-fuels and include methane, methanol and kerosene (jet fuel), and are a subset of hydrogen 
derivatives (which also include use as feedstock). 

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 225 

This section explains both aspects and suggests 
some alternative options to deal with them. 
Allocation of emissions associated with the CO2 source 
The key factors that define GHG emissions accounting for synthetic fuels are the 
boundaries of the system and the methodological approach used. With regards to 
boundaries, the options are gate-to-gate (excluding both raw material processing and 
downstream fuel use), cradle-to-gate (which expands the scope to the raw materials), 
and cradle-to-grave (which expands the scope to the product use as well). The 
suggested scope for carbon capture and use applications is cradle-to-grave, but a 
smaller scope (cradle-to-gate) might be justified in cases where the downstream 
emissions, technical performance, and end-of-life are identical and the purpose of 
accounting is to compare different routes. In practical terms, this means that on the 
supply side of synthetic fuels, the CO2 used should not be considered as having 
negative emissions (under the assumption that it is being consumed in the process). 
Instead, it should be treated in the same way as any other process feedstock, with 
the emissions associated with its production accounted for in the stream. This is 
especially important when the CO2 source is from fossil origin, resulting in net positive 
CO2 emissions. Even for biogenic CO2 sources, the CO2 used should be counted 
explicitly at each stage of the life cycle since, for example, in methanation or synthetic 
kerosene, part of the CO2 input might end up being released as fugitive methane, 
which has a higher GWP than CO2. This may be overlooked if it is assumed that the 
CO2 input is equal to the amount that will be emitted later. 
The CO2 source will, in most cases, have been produced as a result of processes 
that have multiple useful products. For example, cement plants with CO2 capture 
emit CO2 along with the cement (Figure 7.10). This raises the question of how to 
allocate the CO2 emissions of the cement plant across its different products (cement, 
captured CO2, electricity), with methodological approaches typically using one of two 
fundamental options: 
 Attributional methodology: Quantifies the environmental impacts of a product or 
service over its lifecycle as a part of a current system. Total CO2 emissions from a 
process are allocated among the products in proportion to their energy content, mass 
or economic value. 
 Consequential methodology: Quantifies the environmental impacts of a change in 
the system. It includes indirect effects and considers the consequences beyond the 
system under study. 
The suggested approach from an LCA perspective is to use a consequential 
approach and expand the boundaries of the system analysed to include the upstream CO2 production.
  
This does not mean that the fuel production is considered as CO2 storage, but it means that the end use phase is out of 
scope since it does not make a difference when comparing pathways. 
Direct air capture is the only exception where CO2 is the only product. 

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 226  
This solves the problem of allocation method among products since 
now all the products are included in the functional unit. Other minor by-products 
that are not part of the functional unit can still be considered by using the 
environmental burden avoided from their counterfactual production (i.e. substitution). 
Expanding the boundaries of the system solves the challenge of accounting for 
products that have multiple functions, but it may be more difficult to implement in 
regulation, given that it cuts across processes. The ISO Technical Specification for 
hydrogen provides guidance in this respect and suggest a hierarchy of steps to follow. 
Figure 7.10 Alternative boundary definitions used to account for GHG emissions from 
methanol using CO2 sourced from a cement plant 
Notes: Some steps are omitted in the figure for simplicity, including methane production and processing, CO2 transport and 
water treatment for electrolysis, but should be part of the emissions embedded to the various streams. The additional heat 
stream for CO2 capture in the gas power plant is not included, assuming that heat can provided by steam generation in the 
plant at the expense of lower electricity production. Assuming 94% CO2 capture for the cement plant. Heat released in 
methanol synthesis based on direct CO2 use. Heat and mass balance for the cement plant (integrated with power generation)

The choice of boundaries of the system can have a large impact on the GHG emissions 
considered for the product. 
 
This is usually the output of the process of interest, and it represents the basis used for expressing the emissions.

All the emissions are included, and 
the functional unit is expanded to 
cover the electricity (1 GJ of methanol 
plus 0.29 GJ of electricity). 
Notes: Economic value considers an electricity price of USD 70/MWh, a CO2 price of USD 80/tCO2 and a cement price of 
USD 55/t. Values consider avoided burden from co-products assuming heat from a natural gas boiler with 90% efficiency is 
displaced and specific emissions from oxygen production of 240 g CO2 per kg of oxygen. Electricity from the grid (for methanol 
synthesis) assumes a grid emissions intensity of 250 g CO2-eq/kWh. 
Using the approach of system expansion to cover a new functional unit and avoided 
burden (as shown in the last row of Table 7.2) provides more room for different 
results. For example, the electricity could be assumed to displace the average 
electricity mix in the grid on an annual basis, for a specific period, or from a specific 
power generation technology. The definition of the functional unit is also key. For 
example, if the functional unit changes to one unit of electricity, a CO2 benefit could 
be taken for the avoided burden for the methanol production (presumably from natural 
gas without capture). This highlights the importance of the design of the regulation 
and the need for harmonisation across countries to ensure differences in these 
methodological choices do not become a barrier for trade. 
The choice of the approach used is not only a matter of methodology, and could also 
be influenced by national regulation. For example, the EU Emissions Trading System 
(ETS) does not favour CO2 use, and considers the CO2 to have been emitted when it 
is used (e.g. for synthetic fuels). A review of the ETS is due in 2026, in which the 
European Commission expects to assess in more detail the case where CO2 is used 
for non-permanent products (such as carbon-based fuels). It will also assess if the 
accounting should be done at the point of emission to the atmosphere (i.e. 
downstream accounting), or when the CO2 is initially captured (upstream accounting). 
Under the Renewable Energy Directive, synthetic fuels with CO2 sourced from power plants are only allowed until 2035, whereas those with biogenic CO2 or CO2 from 
direct air capture are allowed for the entire period to 2050.

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives 
PAGE | 228  
Another example is from 
the United Kingdom, where an allocation method based on energy is proposed as a 
way of allocating the emissions of processes that produce synthetic fuels and other 
co-products. 
Allocation of CO2 emissions among stakeholders in the supply 
chain 
In the example of methanol used above (Figure 7.10), allocating the CO2 emissions 
from the final use of methanol in ships among stakeholders can make a big difference 
for each stakeholder in the value chain, since other emissions are relatively small. 
The emissions could be allocated to the process that originally produced the CO2 (in 
the example above, the cement plant) under the logic that since CO2 is not being 
stored, then no benefit can be taken by such facility. This is the approach used, for 
example, in the EU ETS. This would mean higher emissions for this step, since the 
carbon capture unit consumes additional energy. The result would be an increase of 
more than 16 times the emissions allocated to that step, in comparison to the case 
where all the emissions are allocated to another step in the supply chain (Figure 
7.11). 
The emissions could also be allocated to the synthetic fuel plant, under the logic that 
if there is no certification scheme in place to differentiate between the low-emissions 
and carbon-intensive commodities, the synthetic fuel should receive the penalty for 
the fuel that is combusted downstream. Allocating the emissions to the end use in 
this way results in the largest difference for different stakeholders, since there are no 
other emissions produced by this process other than those from combustion. 
Allocation to this step could be justified under the “polluter pays” principle. 
 
Other ETS facilities (like cement) are allowed until 2040.

Figure 7.11 he result of alternative approaches to allocating the CO2 emissions from 
synthetic fuel combustion 
There are several ways of allocating the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion among 
stakeholders in the supply chain, with significantly different results. 
The way that emissions are allocated should also be considered in light of the 
distribution of the price premium for producing a commodity with lower lifecycle 
emissions. For example, if the emissions are fully allocated to the end use, but the 
price premium is received by the synthetic methanol producer, it would result in the 
same emissions for the end use (as fossil fuels), but with higher operating costs. 
There must therefore be alignment between these two parameters to ensure that the 
economic incentives for each stakeholder in the supply chain are sufficient to 
encourage the shift to the synthetic pathway. 
It should be noted that Figure 7.11 shows the extreme cases, and any combination 
in between is possible. The actual percentages could differ not only across regions, 
but also over time and technology pathway. These allocation factors could be set by 
policy makers as part of the regulatory framework for synthetic fuels (or more broadly, 
for CO2 use) or be defined by private actors through negotiations for specific projects 
and applications. 
Using different approaches for CO2 allocation across national regulatory frameworks, 
both with regards to the CO2 source and the stakeholders across the value chain, can 
create a barrier to trade of these carbon-containing products. Producers will need to 
comply with and certify their products against different regulatory requirements, 
increasing the complexity of the process and the transactional costs. This highlights the importance of international co-operation on the matter, in the same way as is 
currently happening for the certification of hydrogen (see Chapter 6. Policies).
  
Assuming that the end user is willing to pay for the lower emissions associated with the commodity. This allocation does not 
refer to the emissions from a single multi-functional process, but instead the allocation among different sequential steps of a 
supply chain.

Effect of temporal correlation on GHG emissions 
Many countries are now defining additional criteria for hydrogen to be classified as 
renewable, clean or low-carbon and for project developers to apply for funding 
schemes or other types of policy support. These are most critical for the electrolytic 
pathway, where most of the emissions are upstream. The most common rules relate 
to the additional character of the renewable electricity, and the geographical and 
temporal correlation of hydrogen production and renewable electricity. All these 
considerations aim to ensure that when the electrolyser uses renewable electricity it 
does not result in higher emissions from the grid by triggering additional fossil 
generation. 
Policies relating to temporal correlation will need to factor in certain trade-offs. The 
strictest framework is hourly correlation, which aims to support the use of renewable 
electricity and emissions reduction. However, this could lead to a cost premium, either 
due to the need for batteries to ensure a steady supply of electricity, or as a result of 
lower utilisation of the electrolyser. At the other extreme, annual correlation leads to 
a lower production cost, but it means, for example, that electricity from solar PV in 
summer can be claimed to power the electrolyser during a night in winter, a period in 
which the actual electricity going into the electrolyser could be from fossil generation. 
Countries have so far adopted a gradual approach to temporal correlation. In the 
European Union, monthly correlation is allowed until 2030, with hourly correlation 
afterwards. In the United States, the draft 45V guidance proposes annual 
correlation until 2027 and hourly afterwards. In the United Kingdom, 30-minute 
correlation is used to determine the nature of the electricity consumed in the 
electrolyser. Australia requires annual rather than hourly correlation (and does not 
have requirements for additionality), in order for production to be eligible for a tax 
incentive, noting that compliance will increase operating costs for projects. Similarly, 
the production-linked incentives from India do not need to comply with any temporal 
correlation (or additionality) conditions. 
A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) can be a way to procure renewable electricity 
when connected to the grid. These can take the form of a physical PPA, where the 
electricity producer and the electrolyser are in the same bidding area, or a financial 
PPA, where there is no need for a physical connection. Regulation might prevent the 
use of financial PPAs, or mandate PPAs as a requirement to ensure that electrolysers 
use renewable electricity. For example, a PPA is not needed in the European Union when the electrolyser is integrating electricity that would have otherwise been curtailed, or when the bidding zone had more than 90% renewable electricity in the 
previous calendar year, but is required in all other cases.
 
Hourly correlation is not needed for areas with more than 90% renewables over the previous calendar year and when the 
project integrates renewables, and it is reducing curtailment.

Figure 7.12 shows the effect that temporal correlation could have on the CO2 emissions 
from hydrogen production for a sample location in Chile, using the hourly average grid 
emissions from 2023. In this example, electricity from fossil generation accounts for 
almost 45%, hydropower and biofuels close to 30%, and the remainder from wind and 
solar PV. With annual correlation, the renewable assets can be oversized, injecting 
electricity to the grid and compensating for the grid electricity used in periods of low 
renewable generation. As the temporal correlation becomes stricter, the specific 
emissions fall, since it narrows down the options to shift around the renewable 
electricity (e.g. weekly correlation would not allow for solar PV generation in summer 
to be used in winter, which is possible under an annual correlation). 
Batteries enable lower emissions for two reasons. First, they allow electricity to be stored 
when renewable generation is the highest, and when the emissions in the grid are the 
lowest, in order to then be used during times when renewable generation is lower and 
CO2 emissions are higher. This then allows hydrogen to be produced during hours when 
renewable generation is low, when the emissions intensity of the grid is higher, and the 
CO2 penalty for using grid electricity for the electrolyser would the highest.

for temporal correlation, Chile 
Notes: Example at a location in the Atacama Desert in Chile with a capacity factor of 38.5% for solar PV (with 1-axis tracking) 
and 38.4% for onshore wind. Assumed 50/50 split for the renewable capacity. Battery size of 6 hours for the annual correlation. 
Electricity surplus to electrolyser demand is assumed to be exported to the grid, with the CO2 credit based on the grid electricity 
displaced and varying depending on the average grid emissions factor. 
The temporal correlation criteria for renewable generation and hydrogen production can have 
a large influence on CO2 emissions from hydrogen production. 

Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives

The specific additional CO2 emissions for a less strict temporal correlation will vary 
depending on the specific electricity mix, the quality of the renewable resources and 
capacity ratios between the assets. However, additional criteria beyond scope and 
methodology are also important, given that depending on the accounting rules used, 
the hydrogen produced by the same assets could appear to have different emissions 
(Figure 7.12).  
Previous research has mixed conclusions depending on the assumptions and 
boundary conditions. The specific effect of the temporal correlation on production and 
system cost, as well as facility-level and system emissions will depend on the specific 
electricity system and market design. Some of the most influential factors are: 
 The flexibility of the hydrogen demand to follow renewable production profiles, or 
alternatively, the availability and cost of hydrogen storage capacities. 
 The presence of other flexibility alternatives for the power system (e.g. 
interconnection, batteries, demand response), which will affect how critical 
electrolysers are as a source of flexibility. 
 Cost factors, such as carbon and fuel prices on the supply side, and the willingness 
to pay for the renewable hydrogen on the demand side, since these will affect both 
the electricity mix and the electricity price point at which running the electrolysers is 
economically attractive. 
With these factors in mind, there are several choices to made when designing policies 
relating to temporal correlation: 
 The use of marginal or average emissions when considering the electricity used from 
the grid and the default emissions factors for GHG calculation. 
 How the temporal correlation is implemented. So far, schemes have opted for the 
balancing to be done on a net energy basis. Another option is to use a carbon 
basis, and ensure that all the CO2 produced by the electricity withdrawn from the grid 
is fully compensated (within the temporal horizon defined), regardless of the net 
electricity balance. 
 Any additional conditions, including exemptions, with a view to market development. 
There is a trade-off between increasing complexity, which might make compliance 
(and, therefore, project development) more difficult, and the benefit of covering a 
broader range of cases and ensuring the use of renewable energy and – more 
importantly – decreasing emissions. Additional conditions can include renewable 
energy shares, emissions intensity thresholds, electricity prices, or full-load operating 
hours of the electrolyser. 
 In addition, as the power system is increasingly decarbonised, the electricity grid and 
its emissions will change. Given the difference between the timeline for grid decarbonisation (5-10 years) and the typical time horizon for projects (25+ years), any policy should provide clarity on the evolution of these parameters over time.
  
See for example: Brauer et. al (2022), Deloitte (2024), Frontier Economics (2021a), Frontier Economics (2021b), Giovanniello 
et al (2024), Ricks et al (2023), Ruhnau and Schiele (2023), Schlund and Theile (2022). 
Every MWh taken from the grid has to be replaced with a MWh of renewable electricity at another point in time within the 
window of the temporal correlation defined. This might lead to the case where the net emissions are positive despite the net zero 
balance of energy.

This will also provide greater clarity for investors. 
This long list of considerations for policy design shows the importance of 
harmonisation of accounting methods and criteria. This is not only critical for national 
emission inventories, and to avoid double counting, but also for the private sector, 
to reduce the administrative burden associated with having to navigate multiple 
schemes with different rules, and ultimately facilitating project investment and 
execution.
 
This is relevant when hydrogen is traded across jurisdictions. For example, the exporting country might use an hourly emission 
intensity based on actual electricity mix, while an importing country might use an average annual value for the previous year. The 
emissions accounted in each national inventory will not match and there could either be double counting or some emissions that 
are not accounted for.

Explanatory notes 
Projections and estimates 
Projections and estimates in this Global Hydrogen Review 2024 are based on 
research and modelling results derived from the most recent data and information 
available from governments, institutions, companies and other sources as of 
August 2024. 
Terminology relating to low-emissions hydrogen  
In this report, low-emissions hydrogen includes hydrogen which is produced 
through water electrolysis with electricity generated from a low-emission source 
(renewables, e.g. solar, wind turbines or nuclear). Hydrogen produced from 
biomass or from fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) 
technology is also counted as low-emissions hydrogen.  
Production from fossil fuels with CCUS is included only if upstream emissions are 
sufficiently low, if capture – at high rates – is applied to all CO2 streams associated 
with the production route, and if all CO2 is permanently stored to prevent its release 
into the atmosphere. The same principle applies to low-emissions feedstocks and 
hydrogen-based fuels made using low-emission hydrogen and a sustainable 
carbon source (of biogenic origin or directly captured from the atmosphere). 
The IEA does not use colours to refer to the different hydrogen production routes. 
However, when referring to specific policy announcements, programmes, 
regulations and projects where an authority uses colours (e.g. “green” hydrogen), 
or terms such as “clean” or “low-carbon” to define a hydrogen production route, 
we have retained these categories for the purpose of reporting developments in 
this review. 
Terminology for carbon capture, utilisation and storage 
In this report, CCUS includes CO2 captured for use (CCU) as well as for storage 
(CCS), including CO2 that is both used and stored, e.g. for enhanced oil recovery 
or building materials, if some or all of the CO2 is permanently stored. When use of 
the CO2 ultimately leads to it being re-emitted to the atmosphere, e.g. in urea 
production, CCU is specified.

Scenarios used in this Global Hydrogen Review 
This Global Hydrogen Review relies on two scenarios to track progress on 
hydrogen production and use: 
 The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) explores how the energy system would 
evolve if current policy settings are retained. These include the latest policy 
measures adopted by governments around the world but do not assume that 
aspirational or economy-wide targets will be met unless they are backed up with 
detail on how they are to be achieved. 
 The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), illustrates the extent to which 
announced ambitions and targets can deliver the emissions reductions needed to 
achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It includes all major national announcements, 
both 2030 targets and longer-term net zero or carbon neutrality pledges, 
regardless of whether these announcements have been anchored in legislation or 
in updated Nationally Determined Contributions 
 The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) is a normative scenario 
that sets out a pathway to stabilise global average temperatures at 1.5°C above 
pre-industrial levels. The NZE Scenario achieves global net zero energy sector 
CO2 emissions by 2050 without relying on emissions reductions from outside the 
energy sector. 
Project status 
For the analysis of the pipeline of announced, four potential statuses have been 
considered: 
 Operational: includes projects that are already producing hydrogen, even if they 
were in a ramp up period and had not achieve their full production capacity. 
 Final investment decision: includes projects that have started construction or that 
have taken a firm investment decision. 
 Feasibility studies: includes projects that are undertaking pre-feasibility studies, 
feasibility studies or front-end engineering design.  
 Early stage: includes projects at very early stages of development, e.g. only a co-
operation agreement among stakeholders has been announced or a general 
announcement of the intention to develop a project has been made. 
Currency conversions 
This report provides the stated values of programmes and projects in the currency 
stated in their announcement. These values, in many instances, are converted to 
US dollars for ease of comparison. The currency exchange rates used correspond 
to an average value for the year of the announcement based on World Bank 
exchange rates. For 2024 values, average exchange rates are based on the 
International Monetary Fund.
