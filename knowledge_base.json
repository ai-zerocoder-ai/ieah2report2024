Focusing on hydrogen’s potential role in meeting international energy \nand climate goals, the Review aims to help decision makers fine-tune strategies \nto attract investment and facilitate deployment of hydrogen technologies at the \nsame time as creating demand for hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. It \ncompares real-world developments with the stated ambitions of government and \nindustry. \nThis year’s report has a special focus on Latin America and includes analysis on \nrecent developments of low-emissions hydrogen projects in the region and how to \nunlock demand and move towards project implementation. In addition, the report \nassesses in detail the greenhouse gas emissions associated with different \nhydrogen supply chains.\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nAcknowledgements \nPAGE | 4  \nI EA.

CC BY 4.0. \nExecutive summary \nMore projects and more final investment decisions, but \nsetbacks persist \nGlobal hydrogen demand reached 97 Mt in 2023, an increase of 2.5% compared \nto 2022. Demand remains concentrated in refining and the chemical sector, and \nis principally covered by hydrogen produced from unabated fossil fuels. As in \nprevious years, low-emissions hydrogen played only a marginal role, with \nproduction of less than 1 Mt in 2023. However, low-emissions hydrogen \nproduction could reach 49 Mtpa by 2030 based on announced projects, almost \n30% more than when the Global Hydrogen Review 2023 was released. This strong \ngrowth has been mostly driven by electrolysis projects, with announced \nelectrolysis capacity amounting to almost 520 GW. The number of projects that \nhave reached a final investment decision (FID) is also growing: Announced \nproduction that has taken FID doubled compared with last year to reach 3.4 Mtpa, \nrepresenting a fivefold increase on today’s production by 2030. This is split roughly \nevenly between electrolysis (1.9 Mtpa) and fossil fuels with carbon capture, \nutilisation and storage (CCUS) (1.5 Mtpa).  \nHydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS has gained ground over the past \nyear – although the total potential production from announced projects grew only \nmarginally compared with last year, there were several FIDs for previously \nannounced large-scale projects, all of which are located in North America and \nEurope. As a result, the potential production in 2030 from projects using fossil \nfuels with CCUS that have taken FID more than doubled in the last year, from \n0.6 Mtpa in September 2023 to 1.5 Mtpa today. \nOverall, this is noteworthy progress for a nascent sector, but most of the potential \nproduction is still in planning or at even earlier stages. For the full project pipeline \nto materialise, the sector would need to grow at an unprecedented compound \nannual growth rate of over 90% from 2024 until 2030, well above the growth \nexperienced by solar PV during its fastest expansion phases. Several projects \nhave faced delays and cancellations, which are putting at risk a significant part of \nthe project pipeline. The main reasons include unclear demand signals, financing \nhurdles, delays to incentives, regulatory uncertainties, licensing and permitting \nissues and operational challenges. \n \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nExecutive summary \nPAGE | 10  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nMap of announced low-emissions hydrogen production projects, 2024 \n \nSource: IEA Hydrogen Projects database (October 2024). \n \nChina and electrolysers – the sequel to solar PV and \nbatteries? \nAnnounced electrolyser capacity that has reached FID now stands at 20 GW \nglobally, of which 6.5 GW reached FID over the last 12 months alone. China is \nstrengthening its leadership, accounting for more than 40% of global FIDs in \ncapacity terms over the same period. China’s front-running position is backed by \nits strength in the mass manufacturing of clean energy technologies: it is home to \n60% of global electrolyser manufacturing capacity. China’s continued expansion \nof manufacturing capacity is expected to drive down electrolyser costs, as has \noccurred with solar PV and battery manufacturing in the past. Moreover, several \nlarge Chinese manufacturers of solar panels have entered the business of \nmanufacturing electrolysers, and today they account for around one-third of \nChina’s electrolyser manufacturing capacity. However, other regions are also \nstepping up efforts: in Europe, FIDs for electrolysis projects quadrupled over the \nlast year to reach more than 2 GW, while India has emerged as one of the key \nplayers thanks to a single FID for 1.3 GW.  \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nExecutive summary \nPAGE | 11  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nTechnology innovation is making headway, with signs \npointing to accelerated progress in the near term \nGovernment investment in hydrogen technology RD&D has been growing since \n2016, and this effort is starting to bear fruit. To date, progress has occurred mostly \non the supply side, and numerous technologies are either already commercially \navailable or close to this point. Promising results are also being seen for end-use \ntechnologies, with several applications in industry and electricity generation \nreaching demonstration stage, as well as significant progress in transport \napplications, particularly in the shipping sector. In addition, the number of patent \napplications leapt up 47% in 2022, with most of the growth coming from \ntechnologies that are primarily motivated by climate change concerns. Increased \nactivity around patenting suggests that additional public funding for R&D and \ngrowing confidence in future market opportunities, backed by supportive policies, \nare stimulating more new ideas and product designs with commercial potential.  \nLow-emissions hydrogen will remain expensive in the \nshort term, but costs are expected to fall significantly   \nLow-emissions hydrogen is an emerging sector and, as such, there is uncertainty \nabout costs. Today’s electrolyser costs have been revised upwards for this report, \nbased on newly available data from more advanced projects. The future cost \nevolution will depend on numerous factors, such as technology development, and \nparticularly on the level and pace of deployment. With the deployment seen in the \nIEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), the cost of low-\nemissions hydrogen production from renewable electricity falls to USD 2-9/kg H2 \nby 2030 – half of today’s value – with the cost gap with unabated fossil-based \nproduction shrinking from USD 1.5-8/kg H2 today to USD 1-3/kg H2 by 2030. \nDeployment levels in the Stated Policies Scenario (which considers existing \npolicies only) mean that the cost range would fall only around 30%. As natural gas \nprices fall in many regions, low-emissions hydrogen production from natural gas \nwith CCUS is also set to experience cost reductions. \nCost reductions will benefit all projects, but the impact on the competitiveness of \nindividual projects will vary. For example, full development of the entire \nelectrolyser project pipeline of almost 520 GW would achieve similar global cost \nreductions as in the NZE Scenario. In China, global deployment at such a level \nwould mean that the vast majority of the production from its current electrolyser \nproject pipeline (1 Mtpa) would be cheaper than hydrogen produced from \nunabated coal. Globally, by 2030, more than 5 Mtpa could be produced at a cost \ncompetitive with production from unabated fossil fuels, and up to 12 Mtpa with a \ncost premium of USD 1.5/kg H2. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nExecutive summary \nPAGE | 12  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nThis cost gap will remain an important challenge in the short term for project \ndevelopers, but for final products for which hydrogen is an intermediate feedstock, \nthe impact is likely to be manageable in many cases. The cost premium of low-\nemissions hydrogen production decreases along the value chain, meaning that \nconsumers often see only a modest price increase in final products. For example, \nusing steel produced with renewable hydrogen today in the production of electric \nvehicles (EVs) would increase the total price of an EV by around 1%.  \nProgress is being made in creating demand for low-\nemissions hydrogen, but this still needs to scale up \nEfforts to stimulate demand for low-emissions hydrogen (and hydrogen-based \nfuels) are now gaining traction as governments begin implementing key policies \n(such as Carbon Contracts for Difference in Germany and the EU mandates in \naviation and shipping). These measures have also triggered action on the industry \nside, with a growing number of offtake agreements signed and the launch of \ntenders to purchase low-emissions hydrogen. However, the overall scale of these \nefforts remains inadequate for hydrogen to contribute to meeting climate goals. \nPolicies and targets for hydrogen demand set by governments add up to around \n11 Mt in 2030, nearly 3 Mt lower than last year due to the downward revisions of \nsome targets for hydrogen use in industry, transport and power generation. Yet \nthe amount of low-emissions hydrogen production that has taken FID (3.4 Mtpa) \nor is already operational (0.7 Mtpa), at 4 Mtpa, is well below that level. The gap \nconstitutes a call for action to industry and governments to facilitate offtake \nagreements that can help unlock investment on the supply side.  \nAt the same time, government policies and targets for demand are well behind the \nproduction targets by governments (which add up to 43 Mtpa in 2030) and are \neven lower than the potential supply that could be achieved from announced \nprojects (49 Mtpa). Policy measures are still insufficient to create the level of \ndemand needed to scale up production to meet government expectations. In \naddition, some more ambitious actions (like the EU targets in industry applications \nor the refining quotas in India) have not yet been translated into national \nlegislation. Moreover, from the around USD 100 billion of policy support for low-\nemissions hydrogen adoption announced by governments over the past year, \nsupport on the supply side is 50% larger than on the demand side. Stronger \ngovernment action will be needed to stimulate demand for low-emissions \nhydrogen as an essential requirement to underpin investments on the supply side. \nIndustrial hubs, where low-emissions hydrogen could replace the existing large \ndemand for hydrogen met today by unabated fossil fuels, remain an important \nuntapped opportunity for governments to stimulate demand. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nExecutive summary \nPAGE | 13  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nThe next steps for certification and mutual recognition \nGovernments are accelerating the development of regulations on the \nenvironmental attributes of low-emissions hydrogen, particularly regarding \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Clear and predictable regulations can \nstrengthen certainty for long-term investments. Yet these frameworks, and the \nassociated certification schemes, remain unaligned across different regions, \ncreating potential for market fragmentation. In response, at COP 28, 37 \ngovernments committed to mutual recognition of national certification schemes, \nwhile Latin America launched “CertHiLAC”, a regional certification framework. In \naddition, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has released a \nmethodology for determining GHG emissions associated with hydrogen \nproduction, transport and conversion/reconversion. This will be the basis for a full \nstandard expected by 2025 or 2026, which could serve as a common methodology \nto enable the mutual recognition of certificates. However, some questions related \nto the assessment of GHG emissions in hydrogen supply chains remain \nunresolved, such as how to account for emissions from the construction and \nmanufacturing of production assets. In the case of fossil-based production, there \nis a need for better data on upstream and midstream emissions of fossil fuel supply \navailable in national inventories in order to ensure robust assessment of the GHG \nemissions associated with these production routes. \nHydrogen can be an opportunity for Latin America in the \nnew energy economy, but is facing challenges  \nThis year’s report includes a special focus on Latin America and the Caribbean, \nfollowing the launch of the IEA’s Latin America Energy Outlook in 2023. Latin \nAmerica is well-positioned to emerge as a major producer of low-emissions \nhydrogen, capitalising on its abundant natural and renewable energy resources \nand largely decarbonised electricity mix. Based on announced projects, by 2030, \nLatin America could produce more than 7 Mtpa of hydrogen with a carbon intensity \nbelow 3 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 (3-4 times lower than using unabated natural gas), in \nline with the requirements of several existing regulations around the world (e.g. \nthe EU Taxonomy, Japan’s Hydrogen Society Promotion Act and the US Clean \nHydrogen Production Standard). However, achieving this potential in full would \nrequire a significant increase in electricity generation capacity – equivalent to 20% \nof the region’s current power output – and substantial investments in enabling \ninfrastructure, such as transmission lines. \nMany Latin American countries already have hydrogen strategies with a strong \nfocus on export opportunities. However, these plans may need to be updated in \nlight of uncertainty about the size of the global hydrogen market. At the global \nlevel, there has been no growth in announced projects linked to trade of hydrogen \nand hydrogen-based fuels in the past year, suggesting that project developers \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nExecutive summary \nPAGE | 14  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nhave instead focused on domestic opportunities. In the case of Latin America, \nthese opportunities are mostly in refining and ammonia production, which offer \nimmediate large-scale applications. In the case of ammonia, developing domestic \nproduction capacities would help to reduce import dependency for fertilisers in a \nregion where agriculture makes a significant contribution to national gross \ndomestic product. \nAs the market develops, new applications in steel, shipping and aviation will \nemerge, together with the establishment of hydrogen hubs. These hubs can open \nan opportunity to scale up hydrogen use and production for domestic needs, while \nalso providing the opportunity to export hydrogen-based fuels, as well as materials \nproduced with low-emissions hydrogen, such as hot briquetted iron, allowing \ncountries that are today large exporters of iron ore, like Brazil, to develop new \nindustrial capacities and scale up in the value chain. A phased approach to supply \nin the region, starting with smaller-scale projects, will help mitigate risks, reduce \ncapital investment, and provide valuable experience for scaling up in the future. \nInfrastructure planning and development, especially in long-lead projects like \npower transmission, should begin immediately to support future hydrogen \nproduction. \nRecommendations \nAccelerate demand creation for low-emissions hydrogen by leveraging \nindustrial hubs and public procurement \nGovernments should take bolder action to stimulate demand for low-emissions \nhydrogen. The implementation of policies such as quotas, mandates and carbon \ncontracts for difference has already started, but remains limited in geographical \ncoverage and scale. Governments can capitalise on the opportunity offered by \nexisting hydrogen users and high-value sectors such as steel, shipping and \naviation, which are often co-located in industrial hubs. Pooling demand in these \nhubs can create scale and reduce offtake risks for producers. Additionally, making \nuse of public procurement for final products that consume low-emissions hydrogen \nin their production, and encouraging the development of markets where \nconsumers are willing to pay small premiums for low-emissions hydrogen-based \nproducts, can help drive early adoption.  \nSupport project developers to scale up low-emissions hydrogen \nproduction and drive cost reductions \nGovernments should provide targeted support to project developers in the scale-\nup phase to bridge the cost gap between low-emissions hydrogen and unabated \nfossil-based hydrogen. Timely support is critical to unlock investment decisions, \nas experienced in Europe with a wave of FIDs after the confirmation of funding for \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nExecutive summary \nPAGE | 15  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nseveral large projects. Governments should also provide long-term visibility over \nthe level and form of support so developers have clarity over future business cases \nand can attract investors. While initial projects may require substantial financial \nbacking, support levels will decrease as the sector matures and costs decline. In \naddition to grants and subsidies, governments can explore other policy options \nsuch as loan guarantees, export credit facilities, and public equity investments \nwhich can help to reduce investment risk and lower the cost of capital, which is \ncrucial for these capital-intensive projects. \nStrengthen regulation and certification of environmental attributes for low-\nemissions hydrogen  \nThe release of the ISO methodology provides a standardised approach to \nassessing GHG emissions. It is now time for governments to implement clear \nregulations that set thresholds for acceptable emissions levels in hydrogen \nproduction. Ensuring regulatory consistency with the ISO methodology and \nforthcoming standards can facilitate global interoperability. However, in addition, \ngovernments should intensify efforts to assess and verify upstream emissions \nfrom fossil fuel supply, ensuring transparency by making this data accessible to \nmarket participants and the public.   \nIdentify opportunities to start developing hydrogen infrastructure  \nGovernments should strengthen efforts to accelerate the development of hydrogen \ninfrastructure to avoid further delays that risk slowing the scale-up of low-emissions \nhydrogen production and demand. Without timely infrastructure deployment, the link \nbetween supply and demand cannot be established, hindering market growth and \ncreating uncertainty for both producers and consumers. Immediate action can \ninclude early planning, a focus on repurposing existing natural gas pipelines and \nstorage facilities to minimise cost, streamlining regulatory frameworks to speed up \npermitting, and fostering cross-border co-operation on hydrogen networks. Public-\nprivate partnerships can also be leveraged to de-risk investments, ensuring that \ninfrastructure keeps pace with hydrogen market development. \nSupport emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) in \nexpanding low-emissions hydrogen production and use \nEMDEs, particularly in regions such as Africa and Latin America, hold significant \npotential for low-cost, low-emissions hydrogen production. To unlock this potential, \ngovernments of advanced economies and multilateral development banks should \nprovide targeted support, including grants and concessional financing, to address \nkey challenges such as access to financing, which is a major barrier for project \ndevelopers in EMDEs. Developing these projects can help to cover domestic needs, \nreduce import dependencies and potentially enable the export of hydrogen or \nhydrogen-based products like hot briquetted iron and fertilisers.  \nShare of energy-related CO2 emisions\nNumber of hydrogen strategies\n60\n23\n30\n54\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nPolicies\n2021\n2022\n2024\n2023\nElectrolyser installation \nBillion USD\n82%\n80%\n47%\n22%\nInvestment\n0.3\n0.6\n2.9\n7.0\n2021\n2022\n2024e\n2023\n9\n13\n25\n41\nElectrolyser manufacturing capacity\nGW/yr\n4x\ngrowth\nsince 2021\nGHR 21\nGHR 22\nGHR 24\n2030 NZE\nGHR 23\n20\n107\n155\n166\n179\nAnnounced electrolyser manufacturing capacity by 2030\nGW/yr\nTotal\nFID\nElectrolyser installed capacity\nGW\n2021\n2022\n2024e\n2023\n0.6\n0.7\n1.4\n5.2\n9x\ngrowth\nsince 2021\nAnnounced electrolyser projects by 2030\nGW\nTotal\nEarly stage\nFID\nGHR 21\nGHR 22\nGHR 24\n2030 NZE\nGHR 23\n90\n235\n420\n516\n558\nLow-emissions hydrogen\nMtpa\nRenewables\nFossil fuels with CCUS\n2021\n2022\n2024e\n2023\n0.6\n0.7\n0.7\n1.0\nLow-emissions hydrogen production \nfrom announced projects by 2030\nMtpa\nRenewables\nFossil fuels with CCUS\nFID\nGHR 21\nGHR 22\nGHR 24\n2030 NZE\nGHR 23\n5\n9\n14\n10\n28\n37\n49\n17\n11\n10\n50%\ngrowth\nsince 2021\nProduction\nGlobal Hydrogen Review Summary Progress\nNote: 2024e = Estimated based on announced projects.

Introduction \nOverview \nThe global energy sector is experiencing a profound transformation as efforts to \ntackle climate change and bolster energy security drive the shift toward cleaner, \nmore sustainable energy sources. In this evolving landscape, interest in low-\nemissions hydrogen has grown rapidly due to a combination of drivers. First, it is \nwidely recognised as a key solution for decarbonising sectors where emissions \nare hard to abate and other options are limited, such as in heavy industry, shipping \nand aviation. Second, the recent global energy crisis has further accelerated the \npush for low-emissions hydrogen, thanks to its potential to enhance energy \nsecurity; as a consequence of the crisis, governments have intensified their net \nzero emission commitments, integrating low-emissions hydrogen into their \nstrategic plans. Third, several major economies have recently introduced new \nindustrial policies in which hydrogen technologies are prominently featured. \nHowever, despite this progress, the adoption of low-emissions hydrogen is yet to \ntake off and there are still significant challenges to be overcome to fully realise its \npotential. \nThis fourth edition of the IEA Global Hydrogen Review assesses the advances \nwithin the hydrogen sector in the past year, focusing on the critical role of low-\nemissions hydrogen in the clean energy transition. By examining developments \nsince the release of the Global Hydrogen Review 2023 (in September 2023) and \npinpointing areas that need further attention, the report aims to guide \ngovernments, industries, and other stakeholders on the steps needed to ensure \nthat hydrogen contributes effectively to a sustainable energy system. \nThe report begins with an analysis of the current state of hydrogen use and \nproduction. While global hydrogen use is on the rise, it remains heavily \nconcentrated in traditional applications like refining and the chemical industry, with \nmost production still based on unabated fossil fuels. Low-emissions hydrogen \nproduction has grown marginally over the past 2 years. Project developers are \nslowly starting to take investment decisions, although they are still facing \nsignificant barriers. \nThe report also assesses the situation of trade and infrastructure development. \nSeveral shipments of low-emissions hydrogen-based fuels, particularly ammonia, \noccurred last year; however, overall traded volumes remain small, and most \nprojects are still in the early stages of development. Activities to develop hydrogen \ninfrastructure remain concentrated on project announcements, with a very limited \nnumber of projects moving ahead to construction stage. The Global Hydrogen \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 1. Introduction \nPAGE | 18  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nReview also presents trends in investment and innovation in the hydrogen sector. \nInvestment is growing, stimulated mostly by policy action, but it is still well below \nthe levels needed for a successful energy transition. Progress in the development \nof key technologies is starting to accelerate as a result of the growing efforts made \nby governments to support innovation in the last decade. \nThe parts of the report devoted to tracking developments conclude with a policy \nchapter that summarises the main new policies adopted since the previous edition \nof the Global Hydrogen Review. \nFinally, this year’s Global Hydrogen Review includes two special focus chapters. \nThe first presents an update of the analysis on the GHG emissions of hydrogen \nproduction following the IEA report on this topic for the G7 in 2023. We have \nreassessed the different production routes with the framework established by the \nISO Technical Specification 19870:2023 and have extended the analysis to cover \nthe whole supply chain of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. The second \nspecial thematic chapter is a regional focus on Latin America and the Caribbean, \nassessing the best short-term opportunities for the region to develop supply chains \nfor low-emissions hydrogen, hydrogen-based fuels and other hydrogen-based \nproducts. \nThe CEM Hydrogen Initiative \nDeveloped under the Clean Energy Ministerial framework, the Hydrogen Initiative \n(H2I) is a voluntary multi-governmental initiative that aims to advance policies, \nprogrammes and projects that accelerate the commercialisation and deployment \nof hydrogen and fuel cell technologies across all areas of the economy. \nThe IEA serves as the H2I co-ordinator to support member governments as they \ndevelop activities aligned with the initiative. H2I currently comprises the following \nparticipating governments and intergovernmental entities: Australia, Austria, \nBrazil, Canada, Chile, the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”), Costa \nRica, the European Commission, Finland, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the \nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, the Republic of Korea (hereafter \n“Korea”), Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the \nUnited Kingdom and the United States. Canada, the European Commission, \nJapan, the Netherlands and the United States co-lead the initiative, while China \nand Italy are observers. \nH2I is also a platform to co-ordinate and facilitate co-operation among \ngovernments, other international initiatives and the industry sector. H2I has active \npartnerships with the Breakthrough Agenda, the Hydrogen Council, the \nInternational Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE), the \nInternational Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Mission Innovation Clean \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 1. Introduction \nPAGE | 19  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nHydrogen Mission, the World Economic Forum, the United Nations Industrial \nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), and the IEA Advanced Fuel Cells and \nHydrogen Technology Collaboration Programmes (TCPs), all of which are part of \nthe H2I Advisory Group and participate in various activities of the H2I. In addition, \nseveral industrial partners actively participate in the H2I Advisory Group’s biannual \nmeetings, including Ballard, Enel, Engie, Nel Hydrogen, the Port of Rotterdam \nAuthority and thyssenkrupp nucera. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 20  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nHighlights \n \nGlobal hydrogen demand reached more than 97 Mt in 2023 and could reach almost \n100 Mt in 2024. However, this increase should be seen as a consequence of wider \neconomic trends rather than the result of successful policy implementation. \n \nHydrogen demand remains concentrated in refining and industry applications, \nwhere it has been used for decades. Its adoption in new applications where \nhydrogen should play a key role in the clean energy transition – heavy industry, \nlong-distance transport and energy storage – accounts for less than 1% of global \ndemand, despite 40% growth compared with 2022. \n \nDemand for low-emissions hydrogen grew almost 10% in 2023, but still accounts \nfor less than 1 Mt. Government action has intensified recently, through \nimplementation of mandates, incentive schemes and market development tools. \nThis could boost demand to over 6 Mtpa by 2030, although this would equal around \none-tenth of the needs of the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario). \n \nIndustry is responding to these policy efforts and signing a growing number of \nofftake agreements. Moreover, these agreements are moving from Memoranda of \nUnderstanding to firm contractual arrangements. Chemical, refining and the \nshipping sectors present the largest amount of contracted demand, as well as the \nlargest share of firm agreements. \n \nIndustry is also making other efforts to facilitate uptake, such as tenders and co-\noperative initiatives for demand aggregation of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels \nand feedstocks. \n \nSeveral large-scale projects for the production of low-emissions hydrogen for use \nin refining, chemicals production and steel manufacturing reached final investment \ndecisions (FID) last year. The committed projects in these sectors could lead to a \ndemand for 1.5 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen by 2030, 3 times more than today. \n \nThere are contrasting trends in different transport subsectors. In road transport, the \nmarket is slowing down, with the focus shifting from cars to heavy-duty vehicles. In \nshipping and aviation, the use of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels is gaining \ninterest, especially where policy support is in place, though slow market penetration \nhas led to the cancellation of some ambitious projects for the supply of these fuels. \n \nIn the power sector, progress is particularly strong in Japan and Korea, where \ncompanies are moving forward with several major demonstrations, and the \ngovernments have established the first auctions for hydrogen and ammonia-based \nelectricity generation.  \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 21  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nOverview and outlook \nGlobal hydrogen demand continued to grow in 2023 to reach a new high of more \nthan 97 Mt, a 2.5% increase compared with 2022 (Figure 2.1). Demand has been \ngrowing continuously for several decades, with the exception of 2020, when the \nCovid-19 pandemic led to an economic slowdown. We estimate that growth will \ncontinue in 2024 and global hydrogen demand could reach close to 100 Mt. \nThe regional distribution of demand remained largely unchanged from 2022: \nChina was again the largest hydrogen user, accounting for nearly one-third of \nglobal demand (close to 28 Mt), more than double that of the second largest user, \nthe United States, with 13 Mt (14% of global demand). Hydrogen demand grew \nmodestly in all major regions, apart from in the Middle East, where growth was \nmuch steeper (more than 6% growth year-on-year, due to an increase in demand \nin refining and methanol production) and India (more than 5% growth year-on-year \ndue to larger demand in refining and the steel sector). \nFigure 2.1 \nHydrogen demand by sector and by region, historical and in the Net Zero \nEmissions by 2050 Scenario, 2019-2030 \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. “Other” includes buildings and biofuels upgrading. 2024e = estimate \nfor 2024. The estimated value for 2024 is a projection based on trends observed until June 2024.  \nHydrogen demand reached 97 Mt in 2023 but remained highly concentrated in traditional \napplications in industry and refining.  \nHydrogen demand remains concentrated in traditional applications (Box 2.1), \nnamely refining, the chemical sector (ammonia and methanol production) and \nsteel manufacturing (to produce iron via the direct reduced iron [DRI] route using \nfossil-based synthesis gas). This demand is almost completely met with hydrogen \nproduced from unabated fossil fuels. As in previous years, the growth in global \nhydrogen demand was not a result of policy support, but rather of global industry \ntrends, and had no benefit in terms of mitigating climate change.

Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 22  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nCO2 emissions associated with hydrogen production and use increased to reach \n920 Mt CO2,1 1.5% more than in 2022 and equivalent to the annual emissions of \nIndonesia and France combined. \nIn the transition to a net zero emissions energy system, demand for hydrogen \nproduced with unabated fossil fuels will need to be replaced with demand for low-\nemissions hydrogen. Furthermore, use of low-emissions hydrogen will also need \nto expand to new applications in sectors in which emissions are hard to abate, \nsuch as heavy industry, long-distance transport, the production of hydrogen-based \nfuels or electricity generation and storage. Uptake of hydrogen in these new \napplications grew nearly 40% in 2023 compared with 2022, although they still \naccount for less than 1% of global demand (and less than 0.1% if excluding \nbiofuels upgrading). In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), \nhydrogen demand reaches close to 150 Mtpa by 2030, 45% of which is low-\nemissions hydrogen. Almost 40% of global demand comes from new applications, \nmeaning that demand in these new applications needs to grow more than 80-fold \nby 2030. \nBox 2.1 \nReporting hydrogen demand in the Global Hydrogen Review \nIn this report, demand includes hydrogen that has been intentionally produced for \nutilisation, including more than 75 Mt H2 which is used as pure hydrogen in \nammonia production and refining, and more than 20 Mt H2 which is mixed with \ncarbon-containing gases in methanol production and steel manufacturing. It \nexcludes around 30 Mt H2 which is present in residual gases from industrial \nprocesses (e.g. coke ovens and steam crackers), which is used for heat and \nelectricity generation. This hydrogen is not deliberately produced for a specific \napplication, rather its use is linked to the inherent presence of hydrogen in these \nresidual streams. In addition, in this report we do not include estimations of \nhistorical use of small amounts of hydrogen in glassmaking, electronics and metal \nprocessing (which account for around 1 Mtpa).  \nTraditional and new applications for hydrogen \nBeyond the existing applications for hydrogen in refining, the chemical industry, \nsteel production, and other specialised applications, hydrogen can also be used in \na wide range of new applications. \nHydrogen has not yet been used at scale in these applications, but decarbonisation \nefforts are expected to drive up hydrogen use in some of these new applications, \n \n \n1 Considering 0 kg CO2/kg H2 for hydrogen produced as a by-product in naphtha crackers and steam crackers. Considering \na maximum of 10 kg CO2/kg H2 emissions would increase up to 1 070 Mt CO2. This includes direct emissions from hydrogen \nproduction and close to 300 Mt of CO2 utilised in the synthesis of urea and methanol, the majority of which is later emitted. \nThis excludes upstream and midstream emissions for fossil fuel supply. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 23  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nparticularly in sectors where emissions are hard to abate, and other low-emissions \ntechnologies are either unavailable or very difficult to implement. \nTracking total hydrogen use alone is not sufficient to assess progress on hydrogen \nadoption, and particularly whether it is happening in the direction and at the pace \nrequired for hydrogen to play its role in the clean energy transition. The use of \nhydrogen by application also needs to be tracked in order to assess uptake in new \napplications. For reporting purposes in the IEA’s Global Hydrogen Review, we use \ntwo categories of applications for hydrogen: \n \nTraditional applications, including refining; feedstock to produce ammonia, \nmethanol and other chemicals; and as a reducing agent to produce DRI using \nfossil-based synthesis gas. This category also includes the use of hydrogen in \nelectronics, glassmaking or metal processing, although these are not included \nin our tracking. \n \nPotential new applications, such as the use of hydrogen as a reducing agent \nin 100%-hydrogen DRI, long-distance transport, production of hydrogen-based \nfuels (such as ammonia or synthetic hydrocarbons), biofuels upgrading (e.g. \nhydrogenation of fats and oils), high-temperature heating in industry, and \nelectricity storage and generation, as well as other applications in which \nhydrogen use is expected to be very small due to the existence of more efficient \nlow-emissions alternatives. \nDemand creation for low-emissions hydrogen  \nDemand for low-emissions hydrogen grew almost 10% in 2023 compared to 2022 \nbut remains very low – accounting for less than 1% of global demand. Low-\nemissions hydrogen is more costly than hydrogen from unabated fossil fuels, \nwhich is preventing its adoption among most existing hydrogen users. This \npremium is also hindering its uptake in new applications in which low-emissions \nhydrogen could replace the direct use of fossil fuels. Without policy action that can \nhelp close the cost gap or stimulate market players to commit to using low-\nemissions hydrogen, demand will remain limited to small efforts from companies \nthat have ambitious sustainability goals, or want to familiarise themselves with the \ntechnology through demonstration efforts before a larger market emerges. \nAgainst this backdrop, demand-side policies are now starting to attract more \nattention (see Chapter 6. Policies), following several years in which governments \nhave prioritised the supply side. With the current policy landscape, demand for \nlow-emissions hydrogen could grow ten-fold by 2030, reaching more than 6 Mtpa. \nWhile this would represent significant progress compared with today, it is a far cry \nfrom the 65 Mtpa needed by 2030 in the NZE Scenario. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 24  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nFigure 2.2 \nLow-emissions hydrogen demand by sector in 2023, and in the Stated \nPolicies Scenario and the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, 2030 \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. “Other” includes buildings and \nbiofuels upgrading. \nDemand for low-emissions hydrogen could exceed 6 Mtpa by 2030 with current policy \nsettings, but would need to reach 65 Mtpa, across many applications, to align with the NZE \nScenario. \nIn the private sector, the number and size of offtake agreements between \ncompanies have grown in recent years.2 These offtake agreements are crucial for \nhelping to derisk investment in projects to produce low-emissions hydrogen. In \n2023, companies signed agreements for more than 2 Mt of low-emissions \nhydrogen-equivalent per year (Mtpa H2-eq),3 of which nearly 40% is covered by \nfirm agreements.4 The largest share of agreements (35%) was related to hydrogen \ntrade projects without a disclosed final application, although all these agreements \nare still at the preliminary stage. The second largest share was linked to the \nchemical sector, accounting for almost one-fifth of the total offtake agreed, and \nalmost half of the agreements are firm. The chemical sector is today the sector \nwith the largest historical offtake included in firm agreements: of the \n1.7 Mtpa H2-eq that have been included in firm offtake agreements across all \nsectors since 2021, nearly 0.6 Mtpa H2-eq belong to the chemical sector. Notably, \nthe NEOM project – the largest electrolysis project in the world currently under \nconstruction – can count on an offtake contract for its full production with Air \nProducts. Other large projects in Canada and India that have very recently \nreached FID also have offtake agreements with the chemicals sector.  \n \n \n2 This analysis excludes numerous small offtake agreements in the road transport sector, which altogether account for very \nsmall quantities at global level. As a reference, global demand for hydrogen in the transport sector in 2023 reached around \n60 kt (see Transport), mostly produced from unabated fossil fuels. \n3 This includes agreements for offtake of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. \n4 Firm agreements include contractual arrangements with binding conditions for both suppliers and offtakers, whereas \npreliminary agreements include other type of non-binding deals, such as MoUs. \n0\n 10\n 20\n 30\n 40\n 50\n 60\n 70\n2023\nAdditional STEPS\nSTEPS 2030\nAdditional NZE\nNZE 2030\nMtpa H₂\n2023\nSTEPS\nNZE\nIndustry\nRefining\nTransport\nSynfuels\nPower\nOther\nDemand by sector\nTotal demand\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 25  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nThe refining and shipping sectors, despite having agreed smaller quantities than \nthe chemical sector, both have larger shares of firm agreements. This suggests \nthat traditional applications for hydrogen (ammonia production, methanol \nproduction and refining) are the best-placed to adopt low-emissions hydrogen in \nthe near term, since they present a lower technology risk than new applications.  \nOther sectors where there have been a significant number of offtake agreements are \nsteel, electricity generation and aviation, with shares of firm agreements ranging from \n20-30%. However, offtake agreements in these sectors are much more regionally \nconcentrated. Most of the offtake agreements in power generation have offtakers \nconcentrated in Japan and Korea, boosted by government plans to use hydrogen and \nammonia to decarbonise power generation, although the suppliers are distributed \nacross Australia, the Middle East, North America and Southeast Asia. In the case of \nsteel, almost all offtake agreements (both on the supply and offtake sides) are \nbetween European companies, which have for many years spearheaded technology \ndevelopments in the sector. Finally, in the case of aviation, offtakers are mostly from \nEuropean companies, a trend that seems to have accelerated in response to the \nReFuelEU Aviation mandates that entered into force in 2023, although suppliers \ninclude project developers in Europe and in North America. \nFigure 2.3 \nOfftake agreements signed for low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-\nbased fuels, 2021-2024 \n \nIEA.

The largest tender was launched by \nTotalEnergies in September 2023, with the aim of decarbonising hydrogen used \nin its refining operations in Europe. The company recently reported that a large \nnumber of offers were received, though at a high average price of around \nEUR 8/kg H2 (USD ~9/kg H2).  \nTable 2.1 \nTenders for procuring low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels \nlaunched since September 2023 \nCompany \nSector \nTendered volume \nDetails and conditions \nTotalEnergies \nRefining \n500 ktpa H2 \n- \nSalzgitter AG \nSteel \nUp to 141 ktpa H2 \nBidders must ensure that hydrogen \ncomplies with the EU regulations for \nRenewable Fuels of Non-Biological \nOrigin or are “low-carbon” according \nto the EU Taxonomy.

In the aviation sector, efforts include the Sustainable Aviation Buyers \nAlliance and the Qantas Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (see Aviation for more \ndetails).

Also in shipping, in 2024 the Rocky Mountain \nInstitute, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, the \nZEMBA and Hapag-Lloyd are expected to launch a new pilot system for Maritime \nBook-and-Claim chain of custody. In the steel sector, in September 2023 RMI also \nlaunched a Sustainable Steel Buyers Platform to aggregate demand for low-\nemissions steel. \n \nBox 2.2 \nCo-ordinated efforts to facilitate market development \nThe uncertainty surrounding demand for low-emissions hydrogen is a significant \nbarrier to investment on the supply side. Similarly, offtakers face uncertainties \nabout supplies being available when they plan to adopt low-emissions hydrogen. \nFurthermore, infrastructure developers require clear insights into potential flows of \nlow-emissions hydrogen between producers and users in order to create viable \ndeployment plans. \nCo-ordination among stakeholders can mitigate these uncertainties by de-risking \nofftake for suppliers, improving visibility of supply for users, and facilitating \nplanning for infrastructure developers. Such co-ordination can, in turn, stimulate \ninvestment flows and accelerate the adoption of low-emissions hydrogen. \nTo improve co-ordination, several stakeholders have launched match-making \nplatforms that aim to facilitate market development in its early stages, connect \nproducers with potential offtakers, assist infrastructure developers in planning, and \nenhance market transparency. Some platform developers also aim to facilitate \nprice discovery. \nThe European Commission pioneered this effort in 2021 with the Important \nProjects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) Hydrogen Match-making \nProcedure, with the aim of connecting stakeholders for the preparation of \nproposals for the IPCEI Hydrogen application, although this platform only operated \nfor a short period of time until the proposals for IPCEI were presented in 2022. The \nfirst platform to have operated continuously was the H2 Matchmaker tool of the US \nDepartment of Energy (DoE), launched in 2022. This tool helps “clean” hydrogen \nproducers, end users and other stakeholders across the hydrogen value chain –\nincluding infrastructure developers; manufacturers; Engineering, Procurement and \nConstruction companies; and researchers – find potential partners to build \nnetworks and develop comprehensive supply chain projects for low-emissions \nhydrogen production and use. The platform is now integrated with the Regional \nClean Hydrogen Hubs Program, enabling stakeholders to share detailed \ninformation about their activities, forecasts and project descriptions. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 28  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nIn the European Union, under the decarbonised gases and hydrogen package \napproved in April 2024, the European Commission has created a pilot mechanism \nto collect, process and provide access to information on the demand and supply \nof low-emissions hydrogen and its derivatives. This allows European offtakers to \nmatch with both European and non-European suppliers. It is expected to be \noperational from mid-2025, and to run for 5 years as part of the European \nHydrogen Bank. \nSome European Gas Transmission System Operators have also launched their \nown platforms. For example, Gasunie introduced its Match & Connect service in \nMay 2023, which helps market parties connect with potential customers, \nproducers, or shippers of hydrogen via an online platform. Fluxys launched a \nrequest for information to collect data on potential hydrogen producers and \ndemand in Belgium, informing its infrastructure planning. Unlike Gasunie, which \ndoes not play an active role in matching market parties, Fluxys is currently \nfacilitating regional mutual exchanges among companies that participated in the \nrequest for information process, specifically in Antwerp, Ghent, Hainaut, Liège and \nLimbourg. \nAt the international level, the Clean Hydrogen Mission has also launched a match-\nmaking tool as part of its Hydrogen Valleys platform, to help stakeholders to \nconnect with the hydrogen valleys featured. Also noteworthy are the activities of \nHintco, a subsidiary of the H2Global Foundation. While Hintco is not a match-\nmaking platform, it aims to improve market transparency by publishing information \nfrom the results of the H2Global mechanism auctions. This includes details on the \ncompanies that will be selling the hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels, prices, and \nlocations for production and delivery, as well as information on the companies that \nwill buy the products, and at what price. \nRefining \nHydrogen demand in refining reached 43 Mt in 2023, over 1 Mt more than the \nprevious record from 2022. Growth in demand has been concentrated in China \n(+0.9 Mt) and the Middle East (+0.5 Mt), whereas demand in all the other major \nregions remained largely similar to 2022. Demand growth in China was a \nconsequence of the turnaround in government policy with regards to restricting \nexports, and the lifting of pandemic-related measures, which led to record demand \nand record high refinery runs at the start of the year. However, the United States \nstill accounts for the largest share of demand and is still expected to process more \ncrude than China through 2024, before being overtaken. \n \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2.

Fossil w/o CCUS = fossil fuels without carbon capture, utilisation and \nstorage; Fossil w CCUS = fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage. “Onsite” refers to the production of \nhydrogen inside refineries, including dedicated captive production and as a by-product of catalytic reformers. \nHydrogen demand in refining reached another record high in 2023, but this trend is \nexpected to reverse soon thanks to measures that could affect demand for oil products.  \nAs in previous years, hydrogen demand in refineries was mostly met by onsite \nproduction from unabated fossil fuels (45%) and by-production from different \noperations (more than 35%), such as naphtha catalytic reforming. The remainder \n(close to 20%) was externally sourced as merchant hydrogen,6 and mostly \nproduced from unabated fossil fuels. \nAlthough demand growth for refined oil products (and therefore for hydrogen in \nrefining) is expected to slow down in the near future, it is not expected to fall \nenough to get on track with the NZE Scenario, in which global demand for \nhydrogen in refining drops to under 35 Mt by 2030.  \nAt the same time, the adoption of low-emissions hydrogen in refining is expected \nto accelerate. In 2023, demand for low-emissions hydrogen in refining reached \nalmost 250 kt, just 4% more than in 2022. Practically all this growth came from the \nramp-up of the Yanchang Integrated Carbon Capture and Storage Demonstration \nproject (which entered into operation in mid-2022) and Sinopec’s Kuqa facility \n(which started partial operation in 2023), both in China. The Kuqa project is today \nthe largest operational electrolysis plant (260 MW), but it has been experiencing \noperational challenges related to lower-than-expected efficiencies of the \nelectrolysers supplied, and issues with their ability to handle power fluctuations \n \n \n6 Merchant hydrogen refers to hydrogen that is purchased from external producers who then deliver hydrogen to the end \nusers, normally by trucking or using regional, privately owned hydrogen networks. In the case of refineries, merchant \nhydrogen is typically produced in plants very close to the refinery, and sometimes even in the same location, but in plants \noperated by another company, given that hydrogen is not a global commodity today. \n0\n 5\n 10\n 15\n 20\n 25\n 30\n 35\n 40\n 45\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2030\nNZE\nMtpa H₂\nUse by region\nNorth America\nChina\nMiddle East\nEurope\nIndia\nOther Asia\nRest of world\nGlobal 2030 NZE\n0\n 5\n 10\n 15\n 20\n 25\n 30\n 35\n 40\n 45\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2030\nNZE\nSource of hydrogen \nOnsite - by-product\nOnsite - fossil w/o CCUS\nOnsite - fossil w CCUS\nOnsite - electricity\nMerchant\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2.

Elsewhere, since the \nstart of 2024, one 10 MW electrolysis (able to produce around 1.5 ktpa H2) project \nhas started operation, in Hungary, and some others currently under construction \nare expected to become operational before the end of the year. However, these \nadditions are not expected to have a significant impact on the use of low-emissions \nhydrogen in refineries this year, with demand potentially reaching 260 kt. At the \ntime of writing, projects for low-emissions hydrogen for refineries accounting for a \ntotal production of more than 220 ktpa have already reached FID or are currently \nunder construction. Since the Global Hydrogen Review 2023 (GHR 2023), a \nhandful of large projects for the production of low-emissions hydrogen for \nrefineries have reached FID: \n \nTwo 100 MW electrolysis projects, one from GALP at the Sines refinery (Portugal) \nand another from Shell at its refinery in Rheinland (Germany), each able to \nproduce up to 15 ktpa of renewable hydrogen. \n \nThe first phase of BP’s HyVal project at Castellon (Spain), with a capacity of \n25 MW (able to produce close to 4 ktpa H2). This could be extended up to 2 GW \nin the future. \n \nTwo projects, one from Air Liquide and one from Air Products, for the production \nof around 100 kt of hydrogen from natural gas with CCUS (both retrofitting existing \nhydrogen production units) linked to the Porthos carbon capture and storage \n(CCS) project in Rotterdam.  \n \nShell’s Polaris project, with an undisclosed hydrogen production capacity, which \nwill capture 650 kt of CO2 from the Scotford refinery and chemicals complex \n(Canada). \nIf all the announced projects for the production of low-emissions hydrogen for use \nin refineries are realised on time (according to their original development plans), \n1.6 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen could be used in refining activities by 2030 \n(close to 1.5 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of development are excluded). \nThis would meet around one-quarter of the need in the NZE Scenario. Europe \ndominates the pipeline of announced projects, followed by North America. The \nmajority of projects have not yet reached FID, but the adoption of targets for the \nuse of renewable hydrogen in the EU Renewable Energy Directive (which are now \nin the process of being transposed to national legislation), is expected to bring \nabout more FIDs in the region in the near future. For example, the Dutch \ngovernment is working on a scheme to award tradable certificates to fuel suppliers \nthat adopt hydrogen that complies with the renewable fuels of non-biological origin \n(RFNBO) regulation in refineries from 2026. Elsewhere, India has also taken first \nsteps towards adopting low-emissions hydrogen in refining, with state-owned oil \n \n \n7 China’s World-Leading Green Hydrogen Project Faces Slow Ramp Up, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, 3 January 2024; \nGreen Hydrogen Production Technology Faces a Reality Test, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, 17 January 2024. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2.

GHR 2023 \nshows the estimated production of low-emissions hydrogen from projects that were included in the IEA Hydrogen \nProduction Projects Database as of August 2023. \nSource: IEA Hydrogen Production Projects Database (October 2024). \nBased on announced projects, 1.6 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen could be produced in \nrefineries by 2030, an amount that is little changed from last year. \nIn addition to traditional oil refineries, biorefineries are attracting growing interest \ndue to the decarbonisation potential of biofuels. Some projects under development \nare already considering the use of low-emissions hydrogen for upgrading these \nbiofuels. Two plants, one in Canada (using renewable hydrogen) and one in \nFrance (using hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCUS), are expected to start \noperating in 2025-2026. In addition, in May 2024, OMV Petrom took an FID on a \nfacility for the production of hydrotreated vegetable oils in its Petrobrazi refinery \n(Romania), which includes a 55 MW electrolysis plant to be operational from 2028. \nIf all announced projects are realised according to their original development \nplants, close to 500 ktpa of low-emissions hydrogen could be used in the \nproduction of biofuels by 2030. \nFinally, hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels can also play a role in reducing \nemissions from high-temperature processes in refineries.

In addition, in March 2024, Idemitsu demonstrated for the first time the use \nof ammonia as a combustion fuel in a commercial naphtha cracking furnace at its \nTokuyama complex (Japan), displacing 20% of fossil fuel consumption in the \nfurnace.  \nIndustry \nGlobal hydrogen demand in industry reached 54 Mt in 2023, an increase of almost \n2% year-on-year. About 60% of this demand was for ammonia production, 30% \nfor methanol and 10% for DRI in the iron and steel subsector – the same sectoral \ndistribution as in previous years (Figure 2.6). The majority of hydrogen used in \nindustry is produced from unabated fossil fuels in the same facilities where it is \nlater used. Carbon capture is a common practice in some industry subsectors, \nalthough most of the 140 Mtpa of CO2 captured is used for other industrial \napplications (such as urea production) and ends up being released, with only a \nhandful of projects storing CO2 underground. As a result, hydrogen production in \nindustry was responsible for around 680 Mt of direct CO2 emissions in 2023, up \n0.6% from 2022, approximately equal to the total CO2 emissions of Türkiye. \nFigure 2.6 \nHydrogen use in industry by subsector and source of hydrogen, historical \nand in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, 2020-2030 \n \nIEA.

Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 33  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nThe increase in global hydrogen demand in industry was mainly driven by use in \nammonia production, with global demand rising by 2.2%, and by DRI, with 4.8% \ngrowth. China remains the main consumer of hydrogen in industrial applications, \naccounting for 34% of global industrial use, followed by the Middle East (15%), \nNorth America (10%), India (9%) and Europe (6%).  \nThe Middle East is currently seeing some of the fastest growth in demand in \nindustry, with a 4% increase in 2023. This is mainly driven by methanol production \n(up 8% in 2023), especially in Iran (+20%), which is investing in methanol \nproduction to satisfy the needs of the chemical industry and the transportation \nsector. Two projects are due to start production by the end of 2024, Dena \nPetrochemical and Siraf Energy, each adding 1.6 Mt of capacity. On the basis of \nprojects that are relatively committed and those already in construction, Iran could \nadd a further 5 Mt of fossil-based methanol production capacity in the next 5 years \n– accounting for a large share of global production, which currently stands at \naround 115 Mt.  \nIn Europe, the 10% growth in hydrogen demand in industry in 2023 must be seen \nin the context of a 30% fall in demand in 2022, when ammonia production dropped \nby one-third as a result of the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of \nUkraine. Ammonia production picked up in 2023 as energy prices stabilised, \ngrowing by 10%, but remains far below pre-invasion levels. As a result, Europe’s \nhydrogen demand in industry in 2023 was 25% lower than in 2021.  \nIn the NZE Scenario, hydrogen use in industry grows to 70 Mtpa by 2030. Meeting \nthis need would require close to a 4% annual increase in production, compared to \njust 1.3% over the past 4 years. Furthermore, about one-quarter of industrial \nhydrogen demand needs to be satisfied by low-emissions hydrogen by 2030, \nwhich would require most new capacity additions to be low-emissions, as well as \nretrofits to some existing stock. Beyond traditional applications in the chemical and \nsteel sectors, hydrogen use also increases in new industrial applications. For \nexample, by 2030 in the NZE Scenario, hydrogen DRI and high-temperature \nheating together account for around 15% of global hydrogen demand in industry.  \nLow-emissions hydrogen production in industrial plants in 2023 was about 280 kt, \nalmost the same level as in 2022. More than 90% of this capacity relies on fossil \nfuels with CCUS, with installations spread across North America, the Middle East \nand China. In 2024, production is expected to grow to 370 kt on the basis of \nplanned capacity additions. There has been relatively significant progress in the \nproduction of hydrogen from electrolysis since the publication of the GHR 2023, \nwith over 1 GW of electrolyser capacity likely to commence production in 2024. As \nmuch as two-thirds of this capacity is in China, and of this, more than 90% is for \nthe production of ammonia. Outside of China, Yara’s Porsgrunn plant (Norway), \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 34  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nCF’s Donaldsonville plant (United States) and the Unigel project (Brazil) are the \nlargest projects producing low-emissions hydrogen coming online in 2024. \nThe near-term outlook for low-emissions hydrogen production in industry \ncontinues to improve: Together, projects already under construction or which have \ntaken an FID would be able to produce more than 750 ktpa by 2030. The vast \nmajority are concentrated in China and Europe (with around 45% and 30% \nrespectively). In addition, there has been an increase in projects for methanol \nproduction, particularly in China, though it is likely that this is for use as an \nalternative fuel (for example in shipping) rather than for industrial use. \nNevertheless, despite this improving outlook, some projects planning to produce \nDRI using low-emissions hydrogen are reporting that availability of hydrogen is \nlimited, and that support to improve affordability is insufficient, which might delay \ntheir planned switch to using 100% hydrogen. \nThe most noteworthy developments since the release of the GHR 2023 are:  \n \nAM Green took FID for a 1.3 GW electrolysis project (India) able to produce \naround 1 Mtpa of ammonia for manufacturing nitrogen fertilisers. This project has \nbeen certified by CertifHy to be compliant with the EU regulation for RFNBOs. \n \nShanghai Electric - Taonan Wind Power with Biomass for Green Methanol8 \n(China) started construction of its plant to produce 250 kt of methanol per year \nusing electrolytic hydrogen.  \n \nThe Hy4Chem-EI project (Germany) is beginning construction of a 54 MW \nelectrolysis project, with an estimated production capacity of around 8 ktpa H2 for \nthe chemicals industry. \n \nYara’s green fertiliser project at Porsgrunn, Herøya (Norway) began operations in \nMay 2024, using a 24 MW electrolyser to produce hydrogen for use in ammonia \nproduction. \n \nProject Oshivela (Namibia) began construction in late 2023 and is expected to \ncome online from Q4 2024. The project initially aims to produce 15 kt of DRI per \nyear using hydrogen from a 12 MW electrolyser (with an estimated production \ncapacity of up to 2 ktpa H2), with future scale-up to 1 Mtpa of DRI capacity. This is \none of the first African projects aiming to use low-emissions hydrogen to have \nmoved beyond feasibility studies. \n \nThe Hygenco JSL plant opened in early 2024 and is India’s first steel plant using \nhydrogen from electrolysis and renewable electricity for the annealing process.  \nMany additional projects have been announced in the past year. If all projects \ncome to fruition, low-emissions hydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS \ncould reach 1.5 Mtpa by 2030, and production from electrolysis could reach \n4.8 Mtpa by 2030 (2.6 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of development are \n \n \n8 4 green methanol production projects began construction this year in China, China Hydrogen Bulletin, 29 April 2024. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2.

This is a noteworthy increase, but this growth is occurring \nfrom a very low base, and the combined 6.2 Mt of low-emissions hydrogen \nrepresents only 60% of what is required under the NZE Scenario.

We estimate that these projects could supply an additional 0.8 Mtpa \nof hydrogen to industrial consumers by 2030 (0.7 Mt if projects at very early stages \nof development are excluded). Some key merchant hydrogen projects that have \nbeen announced are the Baytown project (United States), Sinopec’s Ordos \ndevelopment (China), Project Catalina (Spain), the HyDeal project (Spain) and the \nActis-Fortescue project (Oman). However, the realisation of these projects \ndepends on their ability to secure offtakers for all their potential production (which \nin turn depends on their ability to reduce current production costs), and on the \nprospects for new or reused infrastructure to transport hydrogen to end users. \nThese challenges have already led some of these projects to revise their originally \nannounced plans.  \nUse of hydrogen for heating applications in industry \nPutting the world on a pathway consistent with net zero emissions by 2050 will \nrequire new technologies that are still at the R&D phase today, such as for the use \nof hydrogen for high-temperature heating in industry, which is currently being \ninvestigated across new use cases in R&D projects. Notably, several projects \nhave recently been started (Table 2.2) with the aim of demonstrating the use of \nhydrogen in specialised process heating equipment and extending existing \nexperience to industries outside of the chemical and steel sectors that are not \nused to working with hydrogen.  \nTable 2.2 \nSelected applications of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels in industry \nand associated research and demonstration projects \nApplication \nResearch and demonstration projects \nHydrogen in \nindustrial Boilers \nWhile hydrogen has been used in industrial boilers for many years, this has \ngenerally been in specialised industries with significant experience using \nand handling hydrogen, like the chlor-alkali industry. Projects are ongoing in \nthe food and drink industry, such as WhiskHy in Scotland, and in the paper \nindustry, such as KCA in Australia. \nAmmonia in \nindustrial boilers \nAmmonia, a key hydrogen derivative and hydrogen carrier, could provide \nheat to low-temperature heating in industrial boilers in place of natural gas. \nThe UK-based “Amburn” project aims to demonstrate a megawatt scale \nammonia-fed steam boiler system at a customer site. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 37  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nApplication \nResearch and demonstration projects \nHydrogen in \nalumina \ncalcination \nNatural gas could be replaced with hydrogen as a fuel for the high-\ntemperature calcination process in alumina refining. In 2023 an AUD 111.1 \nmillion (Australian dollars) demonstration project was funded by Australian \nRenewable Energy Agency, using a 2.5 MW onsite electrolyser and \nretrofitting one of the calciners in a refinery to use a hydrogen burner. \nHydrogen in glass \nfurnaces \nHydrogen could be used in glass furnaces, potentially in combination with \nelectricity and other fuel sources. In Germany, Saint-Gobain is using \nhydrogen to replace more than 30% of the fossil fuels used in flat glass \nproduction. Ardagh Group is also replacing 20% of the natural gas with \nhydrogen for the production of some glass bottles, and Schott has recently \nproduced optical glass using 100% hydrogen.  \nBlended firing of \nhydrogen in direct \nfired equipment \nHydrogen is already used in some cases as an additive to enhance \ncombustion properties, and could be used as part of a low-emissions fuel \nmix in many sectors. For example, trials in the United Kingdom have \ninvestigated hydrogen as a partial replacement for fossil fuels in cement \nkilns and asphalt production. \n100% firing of \nhydrogen in direct \nfired equipment \nHydrogen is also being tested as a “full” replacement fuel in some pieces of \nequipment, in some cases using oxyfuel combustion technology. In 2023, \nTokyo Gas and building materials manufacturer Lixil tested hydrogen \ninstead of natural gas for the heat treatment of aluminium products. Findings \nsuggested there was no effect on the quality of aluminium products. In \nEurope, the HyTecHeat, HyINHeat and H2Glass projects that started in \n2023 are looking to develop hydrogen-fired high-temperature furnaces, and \nin the United States an aluminium casting and rolling facility is planning to \ntest hydrogen firing. \nTransport \nRoad transport \nThe use of hydrogen as a means of decarbonising9 road transport continues to \nexpand, increasing more quickly in 2023 (by around 55%) than in 2022 (around \n40%)10 due, in particular, to growth in heavy fuel cell trucks and buses in China. \nIn spite of this, hydrogen demand in road transport reached just 60 kt in 2023 (less \nthan 0.1% of global demand). \n \n \n9 For decarbonisation, the hydrogen used must be low-emissions, although today hydrogen demand in transport is met with \na variety of sources, including unabated fossil fuels.  \n10 The estimate of year-on-year hydrogen demand growth shown in the GHR 2023 (45%) has been revised due to \nadjustments to historic values for average fuel efficiency and mileage. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2.

Assumptions on annual mileage and fuel economy come from the IEA Global Energy and Climate \nModel.  \nHydrogen use in road transport increased by around 55% in 2023, with heavy-duty vehicles \naccounting for almost 85% of this growth.  \nIn China, fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) deployment has focused on heavy-duty \nvehicles, which have relatively high mileages, meaning that in 2023, consumption \nof hydrogen for road transport grew almost twice as fast as in the United States, \nand over three times as fast as in Europe. In Korea and Japan, the light-duty \nvehicle segment continues to be a focus for FCEVs, although growth in this \nsegment is slowing down, and hydrogen use in road transport in these countries \nreached only around 7 kt combined in 2023.  \nGrowth in fuel cell passenger car stock slowed significantly in the past year, falling \nfrom more than 35% in 2022 to just under 15% in 2023, with slow sales continuing \ninto the first half of 2024. In contrast, healthier sales in fuel cell buses and trucks \nincreased the stock by 25% and more than 50%, respectively, between 2022 and \n2023.

In China, \nsales of passenger cars are increasing, with sales of the Maxus Euniq 7 and \nHongqi H5 reaching over 500 and 150 units, respectively, though China remains \nunusual in that the car segment makes up the smallest share of the hydrogen fleet. \nBMW has been piloting their fuel cell car prototype in Japan, the United States \nand Europe, and is planning to begin mass producing fuel cell cars in 2028.  \nThe taxi business continues to be an interesting use case, given the advantages \nof faster refuelling and longer ranges compared to battery electric vehicles, with \nthe French FCEV taxi operator Hype expanding into Brussels. These advantages \nare also seen as having strong potential for decarbonising the delivery business.  \nInterest from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the van segment was \nalso seen with Stellantis reaffirming their commitment to produce fuel cell vans in \n \n \n12 Fuel cell electric vehicles in the United States are concentrated in the state of California.  \n13 For comparison, the stock of electric cars and vans increased by around 50% from 2022 to 2023.  \n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023 Jun-24\nThousand vehicles\nCars\nTrucks\nBuses\nVans\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nJun-24\nKorea\nChina\nUS\nJapan\nEurope\nRoW\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2.

The number of \nfuel cell vans on Chinese roads is over four times that of cars, and accounts for \nover 90% of the global total, further demonstrating the focus on commercial \nvehicles. Nevertheless, fuel cell vans made up less than 0.5% of the combined \nsales and just 0.2% of the combined stock of plug-in hybrid, battery electric, and \nfuel cell vans globally in 2023. \nTrucks \nTrucks are the fastest-growing sector for fuel cell vehicles, with the stock \nincreasing by over 50% in 2023, more than twice as fast as buses, and three times \nfaster than cars. As of June 2024, the global stock stands at more than 12 000, \nbut – as in 2022 – around 95% of these are in China. Nevertheless, this should \nnot hide the substantial growth seen in both the United States and Europe, albeit \nfrom a lower base. By the end of 2022 there were around 135 fuel cell trucks in \nEurope, but that had increased to around 350 as of June 2024. In the United \nStates, over the same period, fu \nel cell trucks increased from just 10 to around 170. The share of trucks in the \nglobal FCEV fleet has therefore risen from less than 9% in 2021 to almost 13% as \nof June 2024. \nCommercial trials to prove the technology and gather data on performance in \ndifferent use cases are being undertaken around the world, including in the \nUnited Kingdom, New Zealand and Saudi Arabia. There have also been new \ncommitments to the technology in the United States, for example through orders \nfor Nikola’s fuel cell truck, which officially entered the market last year, with 35 \nunits delivered in 2023. An order has been placed for a further 100 trucks in 2025, \ncontributing to the growing hydrogen hub at the Port of Los Angeles, as well as \nanother 50 trucks ordered by a haulier that deemed battery electric trucks \ninsufficient for their needs after an almost 2-year-long trial. Despite this positive \nnews, Nikola still faces considerable headwinds, having incurred losses of almost \nUSD 1 billion in 2023. Another fuel cell truck maker from the United States, Hyzon, \nhave halted their operations in Europe and Australia, in part due to having \naccumulated losses of over USD 275 million. This decision can, at least in part, \nbe attributed to lower-than-expected demand following the cancellation of \npurchase announcements, such as by Glasgow City Council (United Kingdom).  \nInnovations to fuel cell trucking are still being made, such as through a hydrogen-\nelectric hybrid system in which the fuel cell acts as a range extender, thereby \nmaking the powertrain technology suitable for a larger share of duty cycles. \nElsewhere, Daimler and Linde have jointly developed a novel liquefied hydrogen \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 41  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nrefuelling process aimed at providing ranges of more than 1 000 km,14 which is \nnow being deployed in Germany. The two companies also aim to support the \nestablishment of a common refuelling standard for liquid refuelling, to enable \ncommercial use of the technology. The use of hydrogen combustion engines in \ntrucks may also support emissions reductions compared to conventional diesel \ntrucks. MAN is due to launch such trucks in 2025, and Volvo Trucks will begin \ntesting in 2026. This technology may have a particular role to play in the medium \nterm, while fuel cells continue to face challenges such as high costs, lower \ndurability in difficult operating conditions,15 and uncertainty around the availability \nof skilled technicians and spare parts. \nModel availability is an important factor in increasing deployment of fuel cell trucks, \nparticularly in the short to medium term, so as to offer customers choice and \noptions suited to their needs, and model options are expanding around the world \n(Figure 2.10). However, given that China has the highest sales of trucks, but a \nsmaller number of models available than North America, it is also clear that policy \n– and not just model availability – is influencing uptake. Europe has fewer models \navailable than North America or China, though new additions are being \nannounced, such as by Symbio (expected in late 2024). Partnerships between \nHonda and Isuzu, and Quantron and Ford, are also expected to add to model \navailability in the coming years. Retrofitting of existing trucks, where the diesel \nengine is replaced with an electric fuel cell powertrain, can also increase vehicle \navailability. H2X Global, who specialise in retrofitting, have announced the \ndevelopment of both a smaller 3.5 t truck as well as trucks in the range of 16 t to \n44 t in 2024.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n14 The average range of fuel cell heavy-duty trucks in the Global Drive to Zero ZETI tool database is around 600 km.  \n15 Internal combustion engines are more tolerant of environmental contaminants such as dust, can operate with lower fuel \npurity, and withstand operational vibration better than the fuel cell powertrains currently available.  \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2.

This figure is based on a continuously updated inventory and may not be fully \ncomprehensive due to new model announcements and small manufacturers not yet captured in the database. Values for \n2022 include models released between 2016 and 2022 inclusive. The database contains coaches, school buses, shuttle \nbuses, and transit buses, categorised here as “Bus”, which refers to those with more than 25 seats. “MD truck” includes \nmedium-duty (MD) trucks, MD step vans, and cargo vans with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of greater than 3.5 t but less \nthan 15 t. “HD truck” includes all freight trucks with a GVW of greater than 15 t. “Specialised truck” includes garbage trucks, \nconcrete mixers, and other specialised mobile commercial trucks. Buses with 25 seats or fewer and light commercial \nvehicles, which have a GVW of less than 3.5 t, are excluded from this analysis. Vehicles of the same model that appear \nmore than once in the database, but with small variations in specifications, such as power, payload or seating, are counted \nas one model. \nSource: IEA analysis based on the Global Drive to Zero ZETI tool database. \nNorth American producers offer the widest range of trucks, while Chinese manufacturers \nlead in the bus sector, with Europe lagging behind in terms of heavy-duty fuel cell vehicle \noffering. \nBuses \nFuel cell bus stock increased by almost 25% in 2023 compared to 2022. China \nagain accounted for the majority of new additions, deploying over 75% of the more \nthan 1 500 fuel cell buses added in 2023, thereby constituting a similar share of \nthe global stock of more than 9 100 fuel cell buses as of June 2024. In terms of \nyear-on-year stock growth, Europe and Japan have similar rates to China, \nbetween 20% and 25%, while Korea experienced an annual growth rate of 130%. \nSimilarly to trucks, fuel cell buses continue to be trialled, often alongside battery \nelectric models. Many European cities have taken delivery of or placed orders for \nfuel cell buses, such as Barcelona (Spain), Bologna (Italy), Cottbus and Oberberg \n(Germany), Paris (France) and Wałbrzych (Poland).

In Duisburg (Germany), a previous \ndecision to use battery electric was reversed in favour of fuel cell buses, with cost \nbeing cited as a deciding factor. The city of Cheonan, Korea, will deploy 350 fuel \ncell buses and the necessary refuelling infrastructure by 2027, through a \npartnership with SK E&S, expanding on the Incheon fleet announced last year. \nBoth will be supplied by SK E&S's plant which liquefies by-product hydrogen for \nuse in transport. However, there have also been several high-profile incidences of \ncities ending trials or retiring existing fleets, citing issues of reliability and cost. \nExamples include Montpellier and Pau in France, Carinthia in Austria, and \nWiesbaden in Germany.  \nKey to the increasing sales of fuel cell buses is sufficient availability. In Europe, \ncompanies such as Solaris and Wrightbus are expanding production. In Korea, \nHyundai has expanded its capacity from 500 to 3 000 units per year in order to \nkeep pace with deployment. In North America, NFI Group are signing fuel cell \nsupply agreements to capitalise on emerging demand. However, by far the largest \nrange of models (and variations thereof) are being produced by a relatively small \nnumber of Chinese OEMs, in order to supply both their large domestic market and \ngrowing overseas markets, such as Australia. Hydrogen retrofits also have a role \nto play, as demonstrated by Green Corp, who are installing their technology in 50 \ncoaches in France, in a segment often deemed difficult to electrify. Finally, the \ncontinued introduction of hydrogen range extenders for buses can enable the \ndecarbonisation of routes currently deemed unsuitable for battery electric buses, \nand demonstrates the potential to combine the two technologies.  \nHydrogen refuelling stations \nThere are now close to 1 200 hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS)16 in operation \nglobally, but the overall total grew only marginally in the past year, as the number \nof new HRS being opened was partially offset by station closures around the world \n(see Box 2.3), and older HRS were upgraded or replaced (Figure 2.11). As in \n2022, China had the largest number of stations in 2023, at over 400, followed by \nEurope, with 280, Korea at 180, and Japan with over 170. This pattern is reflected \nby stock growth from 2022 to date, with China adding more than 100 new stations, \nfollowed by Europe with over 45 additions and almost 60 in Korea. Over the past \nfew years the stock of operating HRS in Japan has remained relatively constant \nand the country is now providing subsidies for the maintenance of ageing HRS, to \ncontinue to meet customer expectations. Korea has provided large subsidies to \nexisting station owners to deal with the increasing cost of hydrogen in the country. \n \n \n16 As of June 2024. This includes only HRS for road mobility applications and excludes refuelling points for non-road \napplications, such as forklifts. There is higher level of uncertainty around HRS stock and additions in 2024 than in previous \nyears due to the number of closures and differences in when various sources publish their figures.  \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 44  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nIn the United States, there were around 90 HRS in June 2024, but stock fell as \nlow as 55 in 2023, with many stations being closed or temporarily out of service, \nalthough some new stations were added. \nIn the majority of the regions examined (see Figure 2.11) the ratio of FCEVs to \nHRS has remained steady in recent years. During periods of relatively high vehicle \nsales Korea has maintained a ratio of less than around 200 vehicles per HRS, in \nparticular thanks to building around 50 HRS in 2022. The United States is a \nnotable exception, where a number of station closures in California (where FCEV \nstock is concentrated) led to significant issues for customers in 2023, though many \nof these stations have since reopened or been replaced, as explored in Box 2.3.  \nFigure 2.11 Hydrogen refuelling stations by region and ratio of fuel cell electric \nvehicles to refuelling stations, 2020-2024 \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: FCEV = fuel cell electric vehicle; RoW = rest of world. The number of hydrogen refuelling stations refers to both \npublic (retail) and private stations. 2024 includes data until June 2024. \nSources: IEA analysis based on data from Advanced Fuel Cells Technology Collaboration Programme, H2stations.org by \nLBST, International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy and Clean Energy Ministerial Hydrogen \nInitiative country surveys. \nDespite a number of station closures around the world, global stock of HRS increased in \n2023, driven by growth in China and Europe. \nLike Japan and Korea, Germany has also been investing in existing stations, \nincluding upgrading them to accommodate heavy-duty vehicles (HDV). This \nfollows a wider trend: over 90% of new European HRS are capable of refuelling \nHDVs, in sharp contrast to 2019, when 70% of new HRS were only capable of \nrefuelling passenger cars. The share of stations in Europe that can service HDVs \nhas increased from 27% in 2019 to almost 40% in 2023.17 The United States is \n \n \n17 Capability here could refer to either the ability to physically accommodate the larger vehicles, having a 350-bar dispenser \n(as is typically used by HDVs), greater hydrogen storage for the larger anticipated demand, or a combination of factors.  \n0\n 400\n 800\n1 200\n1 600\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nJun-24\nNumber of hydrogen refuelling \nstations\nChina\nEurope\nKorea\nJapan\nUnited States\nRoW\nGlobal\n0\n 100\n 200\n 300\n 400\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nJun-24\nRatio of FCEVs to refuelling stations\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2.

These \ninclude stations delivered through partnerships between OEMs and station \ndevelopers to help increase demand, such as by Stellantis (Vauxhall) in the \nUnited Kingdom, Toyota and Hyundai jointly in Australia, and Nikola through their \nHYLA brand in the United States. Further HRS installations have also been \nannounced by companies in Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand and the \nUnited Kingdom. However, in the coming years, by far the greatest number of \nstations are likely to be built in China, which has the ambition of reaching 1 200 \nstations in 2025. This includes 5 provinces and municipal cities each with plans to \nreach 100 HRS or more, and both upward and downward revisions to previously \nannounced plans based on the progression of deployment.  \n \nBox 2.3 \nThe past year proves difficult for hydrogen refuelling stations in \nEurope and North America  \nThe past year has seen a series of announcements that suggest a slowdown in \nthe deployment of HRS, and the closure of many existing stations in a number of \ncountries. Everfuel announced the closure of their Danish stations in September \n2023, and Shell followed by closing their California stations in February 2024, after \nhaving closed their UK stations in October 2022. Everfuel reported low demand as \nbeing behind the closures, leaving a fleet of 100 Danish hydrogen taxis without \naccess to hydrogen refuelling, while Shell cited hydrogen supply issues, but \ncommon to both was a refocusing away from cars to the HDV segment. Even in \nthe relatively strong bus sector, HRS plans are being cancelled due to lack of \ndemand, such as in Edmonton, Canada, or are experiencing substantial delays, \nsuch as in Crawley, United Kingdom.  \nAnother sign that the industry may be struggling to grow was the number of selloffs \nof hydrogen refuelling businesses. In October 2023, UK-based ITM Power sold its \njoint venture Motive Fuels, and in July 2024, French company McPhy finalised the \nsale of their HRS business. In June 2024, Norway-based Nel spun off their HRS \nbusiness into a separate entity, Cavendish Hydrogen, which will focus on HDV \nrefuelling. These companies all noted that the changes were motivated by a desire \nto concentrate on their core business of electrolysers.  \nShaping these trends are three main challenges – low demand, reliability issues \nand drastic increases in hydrogen prices – which apply across all regions to \ndiffering extents.  \nSales of fuel cell passenger cars have not taken off in Europe, leaving much of the \ncostly infrastructure underutilised, and in California, where sales have been more \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 46  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nsubstantial, frequent station downtime has damaged consumer sentiment. \nHowever, it is the widely reported jump in hydrogen price that may be most \ndamaging: in California, hydrogen pump price increased by over 100% between \n2021 and the end of 2023. This issue was most serious in California, but to mitigate \nsimilar issues occurring in Europe, H2 Mobility introduced dynamic pricing, \nwhereby the price varies by the origin of the hydrogen, as well as the size and \npressure level of the station. This allowed their renewable hydrogen sale price \n(approximately USD 10.3/kg for trucks and buses, or USD 11.9/kg for cars and \nvans), to be 25-30% cheaper than the standard price as of October 2023.  \nMonthly hydrogen pump prices \n \nNotes: Values for Japan are an average of values from Chubu, Chugoku, Kinki, Kyushu, Tohoku, and Japan \nMetropolitan.

However, the orderbook for alternative-fuel-ready19 \nvessels has been growing, with over 290 methanol-fuelled vessels, almost 30 \nammonia-fuelled vessels, and around 30 hydrogen vessels20 on order as of \nSeptember 2024. The majority of methanol vessels on order are container ships, \nwhereas bulk carriers and tankers dominate orders for ammonia-fuelled vessels. \nThe orderbook for hydrogen-fuelled vessels is characterised by smaller vessels \nsuch as tugs, cruise ships and ferries.  \nEach of the top ten largest shipping companies by market capitalisation now has \nemissions reductions targets of varying levels. In addition, at COP 28, the Green \nHydrogen Catapult (a non-profit organisation working to leverage multi-sector \nopportunities to simultaneously scale supply and demand of renewable hydrogen) \npartnered with the UN High-Level Climate Champions to co-ordinate a Call to \nAction with Shipping Leaders. This includes a non-binding commitment to \nincrease maritime fuels derived from renewable hydrogen to 11 million tonnes by \n2030.  \nGovernments have also started to take action on this front, with the most \nnoteworthy example being the adoption of the FuelEU Maritime regulation, \nalthough the effect on near-term demand for e-fuels21 is uncertain, given that the \npolicy does not mandate their use before 2030. Instead, the regulation by the \nEuropean Council establishes a potential sub-target of 2% of RFNBOs in shipping \nby 2034.22 Meeting this target would represent demand for 90-105 kt H2-eq in that \nyear.23 The inclusion of shipping in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme also \ncreates incentives for deploying low-emissions fuels for both domestic and \ninternational shipping voyages that originate or terminate in the region.  \n \n \n18 Assuming that 9 700 PJ of fuel is consumed in international shipping in 2030 as in the IEA Stated Polices Scenario. The \nlower bound of the range represents the demand for hydrogen needed to meet the 5% target with hydrogen directly and the \nupper bound represents the demand for hydrogen needed to produce methanol to meet the 10% target.  \n19 “Fuel-ready” refers to vessel designs that have the flexibility and capability to enable a future conversion to an alternative \nfuel. Such designs are meant to facilitate future modifications; fuel-ready vessels may still require installation of the new fuel \nsystem.  \n20 Includes both hydrogen internal combustion and hydrogen fuel cell vessels. \n21 E-fuels are produced using electrolytic hydrogen and include e-ammonia, e-methanol, and others.  \n22 FuelEU Maritime establishes targets to decrease the CO2 emissions intensity of maritime fuels; the sub-target of 2% will \nenter into force only if RFNBOs do not reach 1% of total energy consumption in shipping by 2031. Even in the absence of \nsuch sub-targets, there is likely to be significant demand for these fuels due to the overarching target of a 14.5% GHG \nintensity reduction by 2035.  \n23 Assuming that 1 100 PJ of shipping fuel consumption in the European Union in 2034 is covered by FuelEU Maritime, as \nper the IEA Stated Policies Scenario. The lower bound of the range represents the demand for hydrogen needed to meet the \n2% target with hydrogen directly and the upper bound represents the demand for hydrogen needed to produce methanol to \nmeet the 2% target. Included in the calculation, as per the regulation, is a multiplier of 2 applied to the energy content of \nRFNBO, reducing the actual mass of fuel required to meet the target. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 48  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nBeyond the deployment of vessels and the supply of hydrogen-based fuels, the \ndevelopment of technologies and regulations to support alternative fuel bunkering \nare also needed.24 \nMethanol \nMethanol ships are leading the way in terms of alternatively-fuelled vessels \n(excluding liquefied natural gas [LNG]25), due to their higher technological and \ncommercial readiness, and greater ease of handling when compared to ammonia \n– there are already around 50 methanol-ready vessels in operation today. About \nhalf of existing dual-fuel methanol vessels are oil/chemical tankers, but about two-\nthirds of the methanol-fuelled vessels on order for the future are container ships.  \nToday, limited supplies of low-emissions methanol limits the use of the fuel in \nexisting dual-fuel vessels. Offtake agreements, mainly for biomethanol or \nmethanol from unspecified sources, indicate that the supply of methanol for these \nvessels will grow over this decade. There have also been a few promising \nannouncements relating to methanol produced using low-emissions hydrogen. \nGoldwind has signed an agreement to provide A.P. Møller-Mærsk with 500 ktpa \nof low-emissions methanol to be produced in China, sufficient to fuel 12 large \nmethanol-enabled vessels, with initial production slated for 2026. Ørsted has \nreceived USD 100 million in funding from the US DoE to support an e-methanol \nproject that could produce up to 300 kt of e-methanol in the Gulf Coast region of \nTexas. However, in August 2024, Ørsted scrapped the FlagshipONE e-methanol \nproject in Sweden that they had acquired from Liquid Wind, due to a lack of long-\nterm offtake agreements. Liquid Wind has another two similar projects under \ndevelopment, FlagshipTWO and FlagshipTHREE, each of which aims to produce \n100 ktpa of e-methanol,26 with operation due to start before 2030. However, given \nthe company’s change in priorities to focus on hydrogen, the successful \ncompletion of these projects is uncertain, although their original developer (Liquid \nWind) has recently signed an agreement with Uniper to boost the development of \nfacilities for the production of low-emissions methanol. \nBeyond the availability of low-emissions methanol, regulations around refuelling \nvessels with methanol are a pre-requisite for widespread operation of methanol-\nfuelled vessels. In 2023, Gothenburg became the world’s first port to publish \noperating regulations for methanol fuelling of vessels, and to perform methanol \nship-to-ship bunkering of a non-tanker vessel. Two of the largest ports in terms of \n \n \n24 The upcoming Energy Technology Perspectives 2024 report examines considerations for establishing methanol and \nammonia bunkering infrastructure at ports. \n25 While LNG (which could also be produced synthetically using electrolytic hydrogen) is often considered in the definition of \nalternative fuels for shipping, this report focuses on methanol, ammonia and direct use of hydrogen, as these are anticipated \nto be the hydrogen-based fuels that play the largest role in decarbonising the shipping sector. \n26 E-methanol is produced using electrolytic hydrogen.  \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 49  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nfuel bunkering, the Ports of Singapore and Rotterdam, have also successfully \nconducted methanol bunkering operations of a Mærsk-owned container ship. \nAmmonia \nAmmonia-fuelled vessels are at an earlier stage of development than methanol-\nfuelled vessels, with safety regulations for the use of ammonia as a fuel for ships \nstill to be established. While various classification societies have published \nguidance on the design and construction of ammonia-fuelled vessels, the IMO \nInternational Code of Safety for Ships Using Gases or Other Low Flashpoint Fuels \n(IGF Code) does not yet cover the use of ammonia as a fuel, though interim \nguidelines are nearing finalisation. Nevertheless, ammonia-fuelled engines for \nmaritime applications have been tested, and vessel trials are already underway or \nbeing planned.  \nNotable developments include Wärtsilä launching the shipping industry's first \ncommercial 4-stroke ammonia engine (see Chapter 5. Investment, finance and \ninnovation), while engine manufacturer MAN Energy Solutions expects the \ncommercial sale of ammonia engines to begin in 2027. In March 2024, liquid \nammonia was loaded onto a dual-fuel vessel, and the first onboard combustion of \nammonia and diesel was successfully trialled in Singapore. In Japan, an LNG-\nfuelled tugboat has been retrofitted to run on ammonia, with combustion tests \nindicating minimal nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia slip. Another design being \nexplored is onboard cracking of ammonia for use in proton exchange membrane \nfuel cells, which could allow for future direct use of hydrogen. \nAs ammonia is already a traded commodity, much like methanol, a number of \nports have existing storage and transfer infrastructure. Ship-to-ship ammonia \ntransfers are taking place, while in Norway, safety permits have been granted for \nthe construction of an ammonia bunkering facility. The Port of Rotterdam also \nexpects to be bunkering ammonia in 2027. However, further work is needed in \nstandards development for the safe bunkering and use of ammonia as fuel for \nships. Innovation in refuelling methods also continues, including a truck-to-ship \nrefuelling system. \nHydrogen \nA number of hydrogen vessels have been put into operation, particularly for short-\nrange applications. China launched its first hydrogen fuel cell ship in 2023, and a \nliquefied hydrogen ferry has been commercially operating in Norway since 2023. \nA hydrogen fuel cell barge was launched in 2023 in the Netherlands, and another \ncompleted trials in March 2024. A US hydrogen-powered ferry has begun \ncommercial operations following successful tests for a 6-month pilot. In Japan, a \nhybrid hydrogen and biodiesel vessel completed a certification voyage in April \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 50  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \n2024. Projects have demonstrated a number of different hydrogen technologies in \nvessels, as well as hydrogen fuelling operations. In addition, BeHydro’s dual-fuel \ntechnology has received approval in principle27 from the classification society \nLloyd's Register, a further sign that the technology is moving from demonstration \nto commercial application.  \nAdditional projects are planned that will further build experience with hydrogen-\npowered vessels, especially larger vessels. These include two large hydrogen \nferries (120-car capacity) that are being built in Norway for delivery in 2026, and a \nhydrogen barge demonstrator expected to be deployed in Paris in 2024. Belgium-\nbased shipping company CMB.Tech is constructing four hydrogen-powered cargo \nvessels in Viet Nam, which are expected to be delivered in the second half of 2025 \nand be deployed on major sea routes including northern Europe, the \nMediterranean, North Africa and West Africa. Elsewhere, as part of the SeaShuttle \nproject, \nconstruction \nof \nthe \nworld's \nfirst \nhydrogen-powered \nshort-sea \ncontainership, powered by 3.2 MW hydrogen fuel cells, began in February 2024 \nat the Cochin shipyard in India. Announcements from Switzerland and the \nNetherlands demonstrate the geographical diversity of projects in this space.  \nAviation \nIn the short to medium term, hydrogen-related activity in aviation is expected to be \nconcentrated in the production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).28 The uptake \nof these fuels is easier than less advanced technologies (like the direct use of \nhydrogen) as they can be dropped-in with relatively minimal changes to fuel \nstorage infrastructure and aircraft.  \nMoreover, there are a growing number of firm commitments to offtake hydrogen-\nbased aviation fuels, with several having taken place since the release of GHR \n2023. In November 2023, Air France-KLM invested USD 4.7 million in DG Fuels, \nincluding an option to purchase 75 ktpa of SAF over a period of several years \nstarting in 2029. In January 2024, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Cargolux Airlines \nInternational S.A. committed to purchase 140 kt in total of synthetic fuels from \nNorsk e-Fuel. Finally, in February 2024, IAG reached an agreement with e-fuels \nproducer Twelve to purchase 785 kt of SAF in total, with first deliveries as early \nas 2025. Most of these agreements involve companies operating in Europe, where \npolicies such as the mandates established by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation \n(1.2% of fuel use to be met with RFNBOs by 2030) are stimulating action in the \n \n \n27 An Approval in Principle is an independent assessment of conceptual and innovative shipbuilding within an agreed \nframework, confirming that the ship design is feasible and that no significant obstacles exist to prevent the concept from \nbeing realised. \n28 Here, SAF includes both biofuels and hydrogen-based synthetic fuels which are produced from low-emissions hydrogen \nand a carbon source from biogenic origin or from direct air capture. Hydrogen is also considered a SAF and is used in the \nproduction of certain biofuels, such as in the case of hydrogenated vegetable oils. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 51  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nsector, despite some concerns among aviation companies about the security of \nsupply of these fuels. The industry also faces headwinds such as the \nannouncement from Vattenfall and Shell to pause collaboration on their HySkies \nproject in Sweden, which had aimed to produce 82 ktpa of e-SAF. Meeting the \nReFuelEU Aviation mandate in 2030 would require 0.6 Mt of synthetic kerosene \n(0.3 Mt H2-eq) in that year.29 The three aforementioned projects could account for \n0.25 Mt of fuel production in 2030, or close to half of the ReFuelEU target.30 \nIn addition, sectoral coalitions of private companies have been launched to \naggregate demand for SAF through the joint purchase of SAF certificates. \nAlthough this is not exclusively for hydrogen-based SAF (the certificates also \ninclude biofuels), it can help to scale uptake. Aggregating purchase power in this \nway increases the size of the funds raised, which can then be channelled to invest \nin new production facilities that sell their fuels in the general market. Examples \ninclude the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (which in April 2024 undertook \nthe largest-ever collective purchase of SAF certificates, with close to \n20 businesses spending nearly USD 200 million on certificates) and the Qantas \nSustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition, which recently expanded its membership.  \nDirect use of hydrogen in aircraft is still in development, and given that the industry \nhas strict regulations, any novel hydrogen aircraft are likely to spend a long time \nat the demonstration phase before seeing commercial use (see Chapter 5. \nInvestment, finance and innovation). One of the best-known hydrogen aircraft \ndevelopment programmes is Airbus ZEROe, which investigates hydrogen \ncombustion and fuel cells, and in January 2024 they opened a centre in Germany \nfocusing on cryogenic liquefied hydrogen storage and delivery. Airbus also \npartners with other companies working to advance fuel cells for use in aviation. \nHowever, most announcements in this space come from start-ups such as Fokker \nNext Gen, which aims to build liquefied hydrogen-powered narrow-body jets, or \nhydrogen aircraft propulsion manufacturer ZeroAvia. Though still at the business \ndevelopment stage, ZeroAvia have demonstrated sufficient progress to generate \norders for their fuel cell-based powertrains, which currently target retrofits of the \n10-20 and 40-80 seater aircraft sizes.  \nHowever, these start-up companies face multiple challenges, as evidenced by the \nannounced closure of the high-profile Universal Hydrogen project, in spite of \nhaving achieved significant technical milestones. Their novel approach was for a \nmodular liquefied hydrogen fuel storage system, but developing this system while \nalso retrofitting aircraft proved costly. The company was unable to develop a \nsustainable business model and failed to secure additional investment.  \n \n \n29 Assuming 2 200 PJ of fuel is consumed in aviation in the European Union in 2030 as per the IEA Stated Policies Scenario \nand that the target is met using synthetic kerosene.  \n30 Assuming that the announced total volumes are delivered equally across 5 years including 2030.  \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 52  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nAlthough Schiphol airport (Netherlands) is aiming to facilitate the first hydrogen-\npowered international flight in 2024, the earliest significant use of hydrogen in the \naviation industry has been in powering ground vehicles. The intention is to develop \ninfrastructure that could later benefit hydrogen planes, though the fact that \napplications for both gaseous and liquefied hydrogen are being developed \npresents a risk to this strategy. Overlapping consortia aiming to test, develop, and \nestablish hydrogen as a fuel for use in airports have been established in \nNew Zealand, North America, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, where Bristol \nAirport has made substantial progress and had completed some tests by April \n2024.  \nHydrogen is also being considered for non-conventional aviation applications \nwhere it offers sufficient energy density and potential emissions reductions. \nExamples include a cartridge-based fuel storage solution for a prototype \nunmanned aerial vehicle, and two vertical take-off and landing aircraft, one in \nAustralia and one in Switzerland.  \nOther non-road sectors \nRail \nHydrogen fuel cell trains are being trialled in a diverse range of settings, and a \nrecent review includes 15 hydrogen rail trials announced between 2018 and 2024 \nto assess its suitability for local (Japan), intercity (India), and freight trains \n(Austria). Hydrogen trains also continue to set records for distance travelled on a \nsingle refuel – 2 803 km versus 244 km for a battery-powered version – \ndemonstrating their potential advantages. In addition, rail operators in France, Italy \nand the United States have placed orders for battery-hydrogen trains in the past \nyear.  \nHowever, there are still significant headwinds for hydrogen in rail, with many \nprojects being cancelled or failing to make progress. The earliest of the \naforementioned trials, by the German rail operator in Lower Saxony, has since \nopted for battery electric trains as the technology of choice for decarbonisation. \nAnother operator in Austria has dropped their plans to adopt hydrogen trains in \nfavour of battery electric less than 1 year after endorsing the technology, while \ntenders for hydrogen trains in Romania and the Netherlands did not receive any \nbids. These announcements suggest a trend towards electrification as the most \ncommon path towards decarbonising railways.  \nIndustrial, heavy, and other machinery \nLow-emissions hydrogen is an attractive option for decarbonising applications that \ncombine the need for remote, continuous operation with a high-power demand. At \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 53  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nthe smaller end of the scale are forklifts, where hydrogen continues to see \nsignificant uptake, with approximately 69 000 in the United States alone, up from \naround 60 000 in 2022.31 The technology required is mature and cost-effective, \noffering the higher uptime required and therefore often offering a favourable total \ncost of ownership (TCO) compared to alternatives, with companies such as Plug \nmaking frequent new announcements in this space.  \nAt the other end of the scale in terms of size are machines such as excavators, \nwith Applied Hydrogen powering a 30-tonne machine with fuel cells, in what is \nanother step towards widespread decarbonisation of construction equipment. In \nthe mining sector, where remote, extremely heavy operations are common, \nLiebherr is developing both a hydrogen-powered and battery electric version of \ntheir haul truck, while Komatsu are also developing a hydrogen haul truck based \non their existing battery electric solution.  \nIn other applications in which heavy-duty, continuous operations appear to favour \nhydrogen, such as in port handling equipment, the role of hydrogen is still to be \nseen. The Port of Valencia in Spain, and the Port of Los Angeles in the \nUnited States, are pioneering hydrogen-powered cargo-handling equipment, with \nthe latter introducing the world’s first hydrogen rubber-tyred gantry crane building \non their Shore to Store project.  \nBuildings \nThe contribution of hydrogen to meeting energy demand and supporting \ndecarbonisation in the buildings sector remains negligible, with no significant \ndevelopments in 2023. Electrification, district heating and distributed renewables \nare well ahead of hydrogen technologies in fulfilling this need. Under current \npolicies, the role of hydrogen is expected to remain marginal in the future, reaching \njust 20 ktpa by 2030 (0.002% of total energy demand in the sector), while in the \nNZE Scenario, global hydrogen use meets only around 0.13% of total demand in \nbuildings by 2030. \nThere has been little progress in 2023 on the deployment of technologies that \nmight run on hydrogen. Where fuel cells are installed – mostly in Europe, Japan, \nKorea and the United States – they predominantly run on natural gas, which is \npre-reformed into hydrogen in the fuel cell before being used to produce heat and \npower. In Japan, thanks to the ENE-FARM project, the stock of deployed fuel cell \nmicro-combined heat and power (CHP) units surpassed 500 000 at the end of \n2023, even though yearly installations have declined by more than 15% year-on-\nyear.  \n \n \n31 Fuel cell forklifts still remain a niche technology with over 190 000 electric forklifts expected to be sold in 2024 alone.  \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 54  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nFuel cells running on pure hydrogen (supplied by a refinery) were installed in an \napartment building complex in Korea in mid-2024, and provided 840 MWh of \nelectricity in June 2024, as well as some heat.  \nOther advances in the use of pure hydrogen in buildings, mostly in boilers, are \nlimited to a very small number of pilots and demonstration projects. In Hoogeveen, \na pilot to use hydrogen to provide space heating to 12 homes received the green \nlight from the Netherlands’ Authority for Consumers and Markets after 1 year of \ndelay. In Fife (Scotland), the 300-home hydrogen heating trial that was expected \nto be launched in the second half of 2024 has been delayed amid supply chain \nchallenges. Some of these pilots face low social acceptance, which can \nsignificantly delay further demonstration projects showcasing the use of hydrogen \nin buildings – continuing the trend seen last year. For example, in May 2024, the \nUK government shelved plans for Britain’s largest trial using hydrogen for heating, \na decision that came after already abandoning plans for two smaller hydrogen \ntrials, in Redcar and in Whitby, Cheshire.  \nElectricity generation  \nHydrogen use for electricity generation currently represents less than 0.2% of the \nglobal generation mix (largely not from pure hydrogen, but rather mixed gases \ncontaining hydrogen from steel production, refineries or petrochemical plants). \nHydrogen and ammonia can become an important source of low-emissions \nelectricity system flexibility and are among only a few options for large-scale and \nseasonal electricity storage. The contribution to total electricity generation is, \nhowever, likely to be limited. In the NZE Scenario, hydrogen and ammonia \ncombined account for less than 2% of global electricity generation in 2050. \nVarious technology options exist to use hydrogen-rich gas or even pure hydrogen \nfor electricity (and combined heat) generation: fuel cells, internal combustion \nengines and gas turbines. Since the release of GHR 2023 (September 2023), the \nKorean company Hanwha demonstrated at the end of 2023 100%-hydrogen firing \nin an 80-MW gas turbine, with nitrogen oxide emissions at less than 9 ppm without \nany specific flue gas treatment. Earlier in 2023, the company had already achieved \na 60% hydrogen co-firing share (in volumetric terms). In November 2023, a 30%-\nhydrogen co-firing share was demonstrated in a grid-connected 566-MW \ncombined-cycle gas turbine in Japan. Gas turbine manufacturers aim to provide \nmodern gas turbines (using dry low nitrogen oxides [NOx] combustion systems) \noperating on 100% hydrogen by 2030. \nInterest in using hydrogen and ammonia as fuels in the power sector continues to \ngrow, with several projects announced in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and \nNorth America. In the near term, the use of hydrogen and ammonia can reduce \nemissions from existing plants, while in the longer term, power plants running \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 55  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nentirely on hydrogen or ammonia could provide flexibility to the electricity system, \nin combination with large-scale hydrogen storage. \nCo-firing of ammonia in coal-fired power plants has been successfully \ndemonstrated in trials in Japan, China and Indonesia (see Chapter 5. Investment, \nfinance and innovation). In June 2024, JERA, the largest power utility in Japan, \nsuccessfully demonstrated 20% co-firing of ammonia at its 1-GW Hekinan coal \npower plant, with low NOx emissions JERA plans to start 20% ammonia co-firing \nin commercial operations in 2027. At the end of 2023, China Energy Investment \nCorporation announced successful trials of ammonia co-firing at its 600 MW \nGuoneng Taishan coal power plant. Around the same time, in Indonesia, PT Indo \nRaya Tenaga tested ammonia co-firing at its Jawa 9 and Jawa 10 coal power \nplants (1 000 MW each), which are capable of co-firing up to 60% of ammonia. \nThe direct use of 100% ammonia in gas turbines has already been demonstrated \nin a 2 MW gas turbine in 2022, with N2O emissions being kept at low levels (0.1 \nppm). Demonstration efforts are also underway in larger gas turbines, potentially \nup to 400 MW by 2030. IHI and GE Vernova are working on retrofittable ammonia \ncombustion systems for existing gas turbines, aiming to address the formation of \nNOx emissions when burning ammonia and to test the combustor at existing gas \nturbines in Singapore.  \nProjects using hydrogen and ammonia in electricity \ngeneration \nAt the end of 2023, global installed power capacity using hydrogen and ammonia \ntotalled around 330 MW, with Asia-Pacific accounting for more than 50%, followed \nby North America with around 30% and Europe with 15% (Figure 2.12). Based on \nannounced projects,32 the power capacity using hydrogen and ammonia could \nreach 7 100 MW by 2030 (5 200 MW if projects at very early stages of \ndevelopment are excluded).33 Compared to the corresponding capacity identified \nin the GHR 2023, this represents a 24% increase. Almost half of the announced \ncapacity is located in the Asia-Pacific region, followed by Europe, accounting for \naround 40% of the announced capacity by 2030. The share of North America falls \nto around 10%, despite a tenfold increase in announced absolute capacity \ncompared to today, which reaches 900 MW in North America by 2030, but is \nsurpassed by project announcements in Europe, with 2 800 MW, and the Asia-\nPacific region, with 3 400 MW. \n \n \n32 Announced projects include plants that are under construction, have reached FID, are under feasibility study or at an earlier \ndevelopment stages. \n33 In the case of co-firing hydrogen or ammonia, the capacity corresponds to the total installed capacity multiplied by the co-\nfiring share in energy terms. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand \nPAGE | 56  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nThe list of announced projects includes some projects aiming to use 100% \nhydrogen. In the United States, Duke Energy is converting an existing 83 MW gas \nturbine for 100% hydrogen use. The peaking gas turbine is planned to come online \nin 2024 and will be linked to renewable hydrogen production from solar PV and \nhydrogen storage tanks. In France, the HYFLEXPOWER project demonstrated in \nOctober 2023 the operation of a 12 MW gas turbine on 100% renewable hydrogen, \nalso linked to a local electrolyser and hydrogen storage tanks. In the \nUnited Kingdom, a 49.5 MW CHP plant has been announced for 2025, running on \n100% hydrogen and being potentially extended to 125 MW by 2028. \nWith regards to technologies, existing hydrogen-fuelled capacity is dominated by \nfuel cells, representing 60% of the installed capacity, while gas turbines and \ncombined-cycle gas turbines account for the remainder. Considering announced \nprojects in the pipeline, gas turbines and combined-cycle gas turbines reach a \nshare of two-thirds in 2030. Co-firing of ammonia in coal power plants is today \nlimited to a few trials, but could represent around 15% of the announced capacity \nfor 2030, with nine projects being developed in the Asia-Pacific region. \nThe global hydrogen- and ammonia-fired capacity from announced projects \nrepresents almost a quarter of the installed capacity deployed in the Announced \nPledges Scenario by 2030 (30 GW), but only 6% of the capacity in the NZE \nScenario (120 GW).  \nFigure 2.12 Power generation capacity using hydrogen and ammonia by region, \nhistorical and from announced projects, 2019-2030 \n \nIEA.

CC BY 4.0. \nAdditionally, several utilities have announced plans to build new gas power plants \nthat are “H2-ready”, or to upgrade existing plants to be able to co-fire a certain \nshare of hydrogen, although the majority have not yet announced fixed dates for \nstarting co-firing. The hydrogen share of this H2-ready announced capacity would \ncorrespond to 3 900 MW,34 but this number is likely to represent a lower range, \ngiven that it is based only on projects for which relevant information has been \nreleased. In addition, other new gas-fired power plants in planning are also likely \nto be able to co-fire a certain amount of hydrogen, although no information has \nbeen made available yet. Likewise, existing gas-fired power plants are able to co-\nfire certain shares of hydrogen, varying from 10% to 100%, depending on the gas \nturbine design.35 Based on information on existing gas turbines in operation, and \ntheir maximum hydrogen blending shares as specified by gas turbine \nmanufacturers, their hydrogen-fired capacity could amount to more than 80 GW \nglobally.36 As before, this represents a lower bound, given that detailed information \nwas only available for 480 GW of the existing total gas-fired capacity of 2 000 GW \nin 2023.  \nAuctions for hydrogen-based electricity generation \nSeveral countries have taken steps to support the use of hydrogen and ammonia \nin the power sector, including through auctions.  \nKorea held tenders in 2023 for electricity generated from hydrogen with a \ncombined volume of 1 430 GWh, without any constraints on the emissions \nintensities of the hydrogen. A tender for up to 6 500 GWh electricity produced from \nclean hydrogen and ammonia was launched in May 2024, for generation starting \nin 2028 with contracts running for 15 years. For this tender, hydrogen and \nammonia have to meet Korea’s “clean” hydrogen definition, which has four \nemissions intensities tiers in the range of 0.1-4 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. For hydrogen \nand ammonia produced from fossil fuels with CCS to be eligible, the capture rate \nhas to be higher than 90%. \nIn January 2024, Japan held its first auction for long-term zero-emissions power \ncapacity for various clean electricity sources, including hydrogen and ammonia. \nThe winners comprise five coal-fired power plants planning to co-fire ammonia, \nwith a combined ammonia-fired capacity of 770 MW (corresponding to an average \nammonia co-firing share of 20% for the combined coal capacity of 3 850 MW [net \ncapacity, 4 100 MW gross capacity]), plus 55 MW for a gas-fired power plant with \nhydrogen co-firing. The submitted bids stayed below the targeted capacity of \n \n \n34 The estimate of the H2-ready capacity is based on individual plant announcements and does not include planned auctions \nfor H2-ready capacity, which are discussed in the following section. \n35 Other factors, such as the capability of the gas supply pipes and valves to handle certain hydrogen blending shares are \nnot considered here, but are, of course, critical to assessing specific plants. \n36 Derived by taking the maximum co-firing share multiplied by the total capacity for individual plants. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 2.

CC BY 4.0. \n1 000 MW, such that all bids were awarded funding at a fixed cost for 20 years, if \nthe project starts by FY2030-2031. \nIn 2023, Germany announced plans for three tenders for hydrogen-ready or \ndirectly hydrogen-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 24 GW. As part \nof the country’s power plant strategy, these plans were scaled back to 12.5 GW in \nJuly 2024. In a first phase, 5 GW of new hydrogen-ready gas-fired capacity and \n2 GW of hydrogen-ready retrofits for existing plants will be tendered. Plants must \nswitch to hydrogen after the eighth year of operation (for new plants) or after the \nmodernisation to hydrogen firing (for existing plants). Winners of the tenders will \nbenefit from support with capital cost and operational subsidies for the cost \ndifference between natural gas and hydrogen for 800 hours per year. In addition, \nsupport for 500 MW of capacity running immediately on hydrogen is being \nplanned. The first tenders are being planned for early 2025. In a second phase, a \nfurther 5 GW of new gas-fired capacity will be tendered.  \nIn 2023, Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority and the Energy Market Authority \nissued a tender for the development of an ammonia-fired 55-65 MW gas turbine \nor combined-cycle gas turbine, using imported low-emissions ammonia. Two \nconsortia out of six shortlisted proposals were selected in July 2024, one led by \nKeppel and another by Sembcorp. After engineering studies have been \nconducted, a lead project developer will be selected in 2025.\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 59  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nHighlights \n \nHydrogen production reached 97 Mt in 2023, of which less than 1% was low-\nemissions. Based on announced projects, low-emissions hydrogen could reach \n49 Mtpa by 2030 (up from 38 Mtpa in the Global Hydrogen Review 2023).  \n \nInstalled water electrolyser capacity reached 1.4 GW by the end of 2023 and \ncould reach 5 GW by the end of 2024. China leads in terms of committed projects \nand could account for almost 70% of 2024 capacity. Announced projects \nsuggests that capacity could grow to close to 520 GW by 2030, although only \n4% has reached a final investment decision (FID) or is under construction. For \nfossil-based production with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), \n14% of the announced potential production has reached FID, boosted by an \nacceleration of FIDs in the last 12 months. Progress is being made, albeit far \nmore slowly than was expected a few years ago. \n \nAround 6.5 GW of electrolyser capacity reached FID in the past 12 months, \nnearly 12% less than in the 12 months prior to GHR 2023. More than 40% of \nthis capacity is in China and 32% in Europe, where there was a four-fold \nincrease compared to the previous 12 months. Committed projects are mainly \nin industry, or to produce hydrogen-based fuels for transport. On the other \nhand, several projects have been cancelled due to uncertainty about demand \nor regulations, financial hurdles, licencing and permitting issues.  \n \nElectrolyser manufacturing capacity doubled in 2023 to reach 25 GW/yr, with \nChina accounting for 60%. This capacity is heavily underutilised, with only \n2.5 GW of output in 2023. Considering projects with FID or under construction, \ncapacity could reach more than 40 GW/yr in 2024. The project pipeline to 2030 \nadds up to more than 165 GW/yr, of which 30% has reached FID. \n \nProducing renewable hydrogen today is generally one-and-a-half to six times \nmore costly than unabated fossil-based production. This cost premium is much \nlower further down the value chain; for consumers, it typically represents only \na few percentage points on final products (for example, it is around 1% for \nelectric vehicles with steel produced using renewable hydrogen), but \nacceptance of higher prices varies by product. \n \nAround 40% of planned low-emissions hydrogen production projects are in \nwater-stressed regions, where using diverse sources of water and managing \nthem sustainably will be crucial. Project developers are exploring large-scale \ndesalination and treated wastewater to secure sufficient water supplies. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 60  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nOverview and outlook \nHydrogen production today \nGlobal hydrogen supply increased by 2.5% in 2023 compared to 2022, to reach \n97 Mt H2 (Figure 3.1). Demand was primarily met by domestic production in \nindustrial hubs, with minimal international trade. China leads in terms of \nproduction, accounting for almost 30% of the global total, followed by the \nUnited States and Middle East with 14% each, and India with 9%. We estimate \nthat global production will keep growing to meet increasing demand, and could \napproach 100 Mt H2 by the end of 2024.  \nFigure 3.1 \nHydrogen production by technology and by region, 2021-2024 \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: By-product hydrogen from the chlor-alkali industry is not included. CCUS = carbon capture utilisation and storage; \nRoW = rest of world; 2024e= estimate for 2024. The estimated value for 2024 is a projection based on trends observed \nuntil June 2024. \nGlobal hydrogen production reached 97 Mt in 2023, practically all derived from unabated \nfossil fuels. China is the largest producer of hydrogen worldwide. \nHydrogen production is today largely dependent on unabated fossil fuels, \ncontinuing the trend of recent years, and this is expected to remain mostly \nunchanged in 2024. The unabated natural gas route dominates, accounting for \naround two-thirds of total production. The Middle East is a key player – it produces \n20% of all the hydrogen from unabated natural gas – with the United States and \nChina together contributing around one-quarter.

In addition, more than 15% of hydrogen globally \nis produced as a by-product in refineries and in the petrochemical industry, from \nprocesses such as naphtha reforming. \nLow-emissions hydrogen production has grown marginally over the past 2 years \nand remains under 1 Mtpa H2 – accounting for less than 1% of global production. \nThis low-emissions hydrogen relies mostly on production from fossil fuels with \nCCUS. Electrolytic hydrogen production still makes up only a very small share of \nthe total, remaining below 100 kt H2 in 2023, and is primarily located in China, \nEurope and the United States, which together account for around 75% of global \nelectrolytic hydrogen production.37 \nOutlook to 2030 \nMore and more projects for the production of low-emissions hydrogen have been \nannounced since the previous edition of the Global Hydrogen Review (GHR 2023), \nresulting in a more promising outlook to 2030. Annual production of low-emissions \nhydrogen could reach 49 Mtpa H2 by 2030, an increase of more than a quarter on \nthe 38 Mtpa H2 by 2030 reported in last year’s publication (Figure 3.2). If projects \nat very early stages of development (such as those where only a co-operation \nagreement among stakeholders has been announced) are excluded, annual \nproduction of low-emissions hydrogen could exceed 26 Mtpa H2 by 2030. More \nthan 45% of the projects in terms of potential production volume are undergoing \nfeasibility studies,38 and a similar share are at early stages. Committed projects – \ni.e. those that have taken FID or are under construction – account for only 7% \n(3.4 Mtpa) of the new low-emissions hydrogen production announced by 2030, of \nwhich 55% is from electrolysis and almost 45% from fossil fuels with CCUS \nprojects. Nevertheless, this is a notable increase from the 4% (1.7 Mtpa) reported \nin the GHR 2023, driven up in particular by projects using fossil fuels with CCUS, \nwhich have seen an acceleration in terms of FIDs in the past year (in the GHR \n2023 they accounted for only 35% of the committed capacity). Excluding the \nprojects at very early stages of development, which are less likely to be fully \nrealised by the end of the decade, the share of capacity that has at least reached \nFID changes to 13%. Approximately two-thirds of low-emissions hydrogen \nproduction in 2030 could come from electrolysis, and this could rise to almost 75% \nif projects at early stage of development are also included. \n \n \n37 Hydrogen from chlor-alkali electrolysis is not included in this analysis. \n38 See Explanatory notes annex for a description of the project statuses used in this report. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

In Europe, nearly 8 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen could be generated via \nelectrolysis by 2030 (more than 5 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of \ndevelopment are excluded). Spain (20%), Denmark (12%) and Germany (10%) \nare leading in terms of announced water electrolysis projects, and could represent \nmore than 40% of Europe’s low-emissions hydrogen production by 2030.  \nIn Australia, hydrogen production from electrolysis could reach almost 6 Mtpa by \n2030 (almost 1.5 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of development are \nexcluded). The availability of low-cost solar and wind resources, as well as its \nproximity to the Asian market, could make Australia one of the main exporters of \nhydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels (see Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure). A \nsimilar trend is noticeable in Chile: according to our tracking, 16 electrolytic \nhydrogen projects, each with capacity greater than 1 GW, have been announced \nin Chile, although almost half of the potential capacity is in projects at very early \nstages of development. Potential production of low-emissions hydrogen from \nannounced projects in Chile reaches almost 4 Mtpa (2 Mtpa if projects at very \nearly stages of development are excluded), representing more than half of the low-\nemissions electrolytic hydrogen that could be produced in Latin America by 2030 \n(see Chapter 8.

Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 63  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nAfrica has seen a significant number of announcements for electrolytic hydrogen \nprojects in the past year, potentially increasing production to more than 7 Mtpa by \n2030. However, the majority of these projects – close to 6 Mtpa in terms of \nproduction – are still at very early stages of development, meaning that their full \ndeployment by 2030 remains somewhat uncertain. This is not the case for China \nand the Middle East, where most of the announced projects are far more \nadvanced, with half of the announced hydrogen production from water electrolysis \nin China, and 20% in the Middle East, coming from projects that are currently \nunder construction or have already reached FID.  \nBased on announcements, the United States will remain the frontrunner in \nhydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS, with 5.6 Mtpa H2 by 2030 (more \nthan 3.5 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of development are excluded), \nfollowed by Europe with more than 3.5 Mtpa H2 by 2030 (more than 3 Mtpa if \nprojects at very early stages of development are excluded). This is an increase of \nalmost 30% for the United States since the GHR 2023. In Europe, these projects \nare primarily located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Norway – all \ncountries with significant potential for CO2 underground storage (Figure 3.3).  \nFigure 3.3 \nMap of announced low-emissions hydrogen production projects, 2024 \n \nNotes: CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage; FID = final investment decision.  \nSource: IEA Hydrogen Production Projects Database (October 2024). \nA larger number of projects have been announced in Africa, Latin America and India in the \npast year, while the majority of operational capacity is in China, Europe and the \nUnited States. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 64  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nDespite the growing number of announced projects for low-emissions hydrogen \nproduction, several projects delayed their FID or were even cancelled in the past \nyear in the face of multiple challenges (see Box 3.1). \nThe 49 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen production that could get the go-ahead \nby 2030 represents close to three-quarters (40% if projects at very early stages of \ndevelopment are excluded) of the total low-emissions hydrogen production in the \nNet Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario). An important gap remains \nto be closed in order to get on track, for which the largest part is accounted for by \nlow-emissions hydrogen from electrolysis, while production from fossil fuels with \nCCUS is already closer to the value in the NZE Scenario. In contrast, under the \nAnnounced Pledges Scenario (APS), the low-emissions hydrogen production from \nannounced projects (excluding projects at very early stage of development) could \nmeet the scenario requirements both for electrolysis and for hydrogen from fossil \nfuels with CCUS. \n \nBox 3.1 \nChallenges facing project developers are hindering faster progress \nSeveral project developers aiming to produce low-emissions hydrogen have \nannounced project delays, postponements to FIDs and even cancellations. Some \nof these announcements have come from highly ambitious projects that aimed for \nrapid market and technology developments (such as the adoption of hydrogen in \nnew applications that are not yet commercial or international trade of low-\nemissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels) or were looking at hydrogen use \nin applications with weaker business cases, or where more competitive \nalternatives are already commercially available (e.g. light-duty road transport, \ndomestic heating and grid blending). The cancellation of these projects suggests \nthat the sector is now maturing and moving beyond the hype observed in recent \nyears, and that understanding among stakeholders about where the real \nopportunities for hydrogen lie – and where efforts must be focused – is now much \nstronger.  \nHowever, a large number of projects, even those built on solid use cases for \nhydrogen, are now facing diverse challenges that are hindering progress in the \nsector. These are the most common barriers facing project developers: \n \nRegulatory uncertainty: Project developers require clear and stable \nregulatory frameworks to secure investments. Although a large number of \ngovernments are making progress (see Chapter 6. Policies), on many \noccasions regulations are not yet clear, which can lead to companies halting \ntheir hydrogen programmes or postponing projects while awaiting clarity. \n \nDemand uncertainty: The slow development of the market for low-emissions \nhydrogen and insufficient demand mean that project developers cannot secure \nofftakers to underpin investments. Several delayed and cancelled projects \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 65  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nhave reported barriers to securing sufficient offtake, in a variety of projects \nincluding methanol production, ammonia production, synthetic fuels and \nhydrogen production for multiple end-uses. The challenges in signing offtake \nagreements have recently led to the cancellation of Orsted’s Flagship project \n(Sweden) for the production of methanol using renewable-based hydrogen, \neven after having taken FID in late 2022 and starting unit assembly earlier this \nyear. \n \nFinancial hurdles and incentive delays: Low-emissions hydrogen \nproduction and use cases remain more expensive than the fossil fuel \nincumbents they could replace. Timely government action to close this cost \ngap by favouring low-emissions solutions over fossil fuel alternatives (e.g. \nthrough carbon pricing, incentives, funding schemes and phasing out fossil fuel \nsubsidies) is critical to help first movers to advance. Governments have started \nto implement support schemes for the first large-scale projects, but delays in \nmaking funding available have led companies to put off or scale back their \nproduction targets, or to delay investments in numerous projects. Even projects \nthat had already received public funding have been delayed and cancelled due \nto increases in financing and material costs that completely changed the \nbusiness case between the time when companies applied for the funding and \nthe funding being approved. \n \nLicencing and permitting issues: Like the developers of renewable energy \nprojects in the past, several low-emissions hydrogen project developers are \nnow struggling to get necessary approvals from authorities, including for \naccess to water supplies and grid connections. Local opposition has also \ncomplicated the obtention of licences to proceed with the development of \nprojects and, therefore, their future operation. Although the complexity of some \npermitting procedures is often cited as the reason for the delays, bad industry \npractices (e.g. submission of incomplete files, poor project management) can \nalso delay decisions from authorities and impact project plans. In the past year, \neleven projects in Inner Mongolia (China), accounting for more than 3 GW \nelectrolysis, had their development rights revoked as a result of delays from \ndevelopers after land acquisition.* \n \nOperational challenges: Although several technologies for the production of \nlow-emissions hydrogen are commercially mature, they are now facing the \nscale-up stage. The change in scale this implies requires new project \nconfigurations that need to be tested and perfected, through a process that \npresents technical and operational hurdles for developers. For example, \nSinopec’s Kuqa project, the world’s largest operational electrolysis plant \n(260 MW), inaugurated in 2023, has faced operational issues with its \nelectrolysers, limiting production, and is not expected to operate at full capacity \nuntil 2025. Other projects operating at a smaller scale have been delayed \n(20 MW project in Denmark) or put out of action (2.5 MW in Spain) for long \nperiods after commissioning due to equipment faults. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 66  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nThese challenges do not occur in isolation, and in multiple cases project \ndevelopers have reported that a combination of issues was behind their failed \nplans. For example, Uniper delayed the start-up of the first phase (100 MW) of the \nH2Maasvlakte project in the Netherlands (which had received support from the EU \nInnovation Fund), after failing to secure a power purchase agreement for the \nfacility, and reporting challenges with high grid fees, uncertainty over sufficient \nofftake, and barriers with regulatory requirements, as well as complex \nadministrative procedures needed to secure funding from public support schemes. \n*Energy Iceberg (2024), Hydrogen Policy Navigator; Six mega green hydrogen projects were cancelled by Inner \nMongolia energy regulator. \n \nElectrolysis \nCurrent status \nInstalled water electrolyser capacity reached 1.4 GW at the end of 2023, almost \ndouble the installed capacity at the end of 2022. This looks set to grow further: based \non announced projects that have at least reached FID or are under construction, \nglobal installed capacity could reach 5 GW by the end of 2024. Nevertheless, as of \nSeptember 2024, only 205 MW of new capacity has started operations. In addition, \nthe installed capacity in 2023 represents only one-sixth of the capacity that was \nexpected based on the announcements for projects at the time that the Global \nHydrogen Review 2021 was published, signalling that progress is being made, \nthough far more slowly than was expected just a few years ago.  \nChina accounted for 80% of the capacity that entered into operation in 2023, \nincluding the largest electrolyser project in the world, the 260 MW Kuqa plant by \nSinopec. About 12% of the close to 700 MW that came online in 2023 was in \nEurope. China accounts for three-quarters of the new capacity additions that \ncould become operational in 2024, increasing its share of global capacity from \n55% in 2023 to almost 70%. Europe and the United States could reach shares \nof 15% and 6%, respectively, of global installed capacity by the end of the year, \nif all projects are realised on time. In the European Union, if all projects meet \ntheir planned timelines, total installed capacity could reach 0.7 GW at the end of \n2024, falling very short of the interim target of 6 GW established in the EU \nHydrogen Strategy back in 2020. \nAlkaline technology continues to make up the largest share, accounting for more \nthan 60% of the installed electrolyser capacity in 2023, followed by proton \nexchange membrane (PEM) with 22%. Despite their lower share to date, several \nprojects using mid-size PEM electrolysers have started operations in the past few \nmonths. At the beginning of 2024, Plug commissioned plants for about 50 MW in \ntotal: the Camden County plant in the United States, for hydrogen use in mobility; \nand the 10 MW electrolyser in the Szazhalombatta refinery in Hungary. Another \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 67  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nPEM electrolyser came online in the United States at the end of 2023, the 25 MW \nCavendish NextGen Hydrogen Hub at the FPL Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, \npowered by solar PV for application in the power sector. In Norway, the first phase \nof Yara’s Porsgrunn (Herøya) project started operating a 24 MW PEM electrolyser \nin the beginning of 2024, manufactured by ITM Power, for ammonia production.  \nWhen we published the GHR 2023 in September 2023, projects in the pipeline \nworldwide accounted for 175 GW by 2030, and as much as 420 GW if projects at \nvery early stages of development were also included. Taking into account the new \nannouncements made in the past 12 months since then, 230 GW of water \nelectrolyser capacity could be reached by 2030, and close to 520 GW if projects \nat early stages of development are also considered (Figure 3.4). The regional \ndistribution could look quite different to today: regions with good renewable \nresources, such as Latin America and Africa, could each represent 17% of the \ninstalled capacity, up from just 65 MW in total today. Europe could reach more \nthan a quarter of the global share by 2030, and Australia 15%. The decrease in \nChina’s share by 2030 should not be seen as a slow-down in project deployment, \nnor as evidence of declining interest, but rather as a reflection of short-term \nvisibility of the projects under development in China, and project announcements \nthat typically occur only when the projects are at a relatively advanced stage.  \nFigure 3.4 \nInstalled electrolyser capacity by technology and region, 2020-2024e, and \ncapacity by region, plant size and status based on announced projects, \n2030  \n \nIEA.

CC BY 4.0. \nBy 2030, three-quarters of the projects could be gigawatt-scale plants, \nconsolidating a trend towards large-scale projects already observed last year. \nHowever, there is continuing uncertainty about the full development of the \nannounced projects, as more than half of the electrolyser capacity is at early \nstages of development and only 4%, or 20 GW, of electrolyser capacity due to be \nonline by 2030 has either reached FID or is under construction. By excluding the \nprojects at early stages of development, which could be considered to be least \nlikely to be fully realised by the end of the decade, the share of capacity that has \nat least reached FID rises to 8%. Between 2020 and 2023, the compound annual \ngrowth rate (CAGR) for water electrolyser installation has been around 60%, and \nif all projects for 2024 are realised on time, the year-on-year increase could be \nalmost 400%. The realisation of all the projects by 2030 would entail a CAGR of \nmore than 100% from 2024 onwards (80% by excluding projects at early stage of \ndevelopment): almost twice as high as any growth experienced by solar PV in any \nsix-year period during the last two decades. \nAdvances \nWhile looking at the entire project pipeline gives a clear indication of the potential \ngrowth in electrolyser plants globally, focusing on the projects that are committed \nprovides a better overview of where projects are moving forward, in which sectors, \nand at what pace. In the 12 months since the GHR 2023 (September 2023), \naround 6.5 GW of electrolyser projects have reached FID, compared to about \n7.5 GW in the 12 months prior to GHR 2023 (Figure 3.5).  \nFigure 3.5 \nElectrolyser capacity to reach final investment decision by the Global \nHydrogen Review 2023 and 2024, by region \n \nIEA.

In that period, more \nthan 2 GW reached FID in Europe, four times more than the previous 12 month \nperiod. The first phase of the Grey2Green project developed by GALP (100 MW, \nPortugal), the Green CCU Hub Aalborg (120 MW, Denmark), the Clean Hydrogen \nCoastline by EWE (320 MW, Germany) and the Refhyne II by Shell (100 MW, \nGermany) together represent one-quarter of the capacity that reached FID in \nEurope, while 40% of it is represented by the Stegra (formerly H2 Green Steel) \nproject in Sweden. In addition, in September 2024 RWE took FID on the 300 MW \nGET H2 Nukleus project in Lingen, Germany (not included in Figure 3.5): state aid \nfor this project was approved by the European Union under the Important Projects \nfor Common European Interest scheme. China accounted for 2.8 GW of capacity \nthat secured investment in the same period, retaining its position as the country \nwith the largest share of committed investments. At the same time, India has taken \nits first big step into the regions with large production capacities committed, with \nthe announcement in August 2024 by AM Green Ammonia of the FID for a 1.3 \nGW project in Kakinada for the production of ammonia in an existing fertiliser plant.  \nThe majority of the announced capacity that took FID in the past 12 months is for \nthe use of electrolytic hydrogen in industrial applications and for transport fuels \n(Figure 3.6). Half of this capacity, or 3.2 GW, targets sectors that already use \nhydrogen today, namely ammonia production, methanol production and the \nrefining sector. These applications are all well placed to adopt low-emissions \nhydrogen in the near term, as the partial or full switch from fossil-based hydrogen \ngenerally requires only minor technical adjustments; they are also the sectors that \ncan already secure offtakes for substantial volumes (see Chapter 2. Hydrogen \ndemand). Of the projects that took FID in the past 12 months, about 0.7 GW are \nto produce synthetic methanol to be used as a transport fuel in shipping. The \nbiggest projects under development are the Goldwind e-methanol project in China \nand the Green CCU Hub Aalborg in Denmark, together accounting for a capacity \nof 0.5 Mtpa of methanol.  \n \n \n \n \n \n39 S&P Global (2024), Hydrogen Daily newsletter, 13 August. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

The first round selected 11 projects in December 2023, for a \ncombined capacity of 125 MW, and could provide up to USD 2.5 billion through a \ncombination of revenue support and capital cost support. However, project \ndevelopers are currently negotiating contracts with the Low Carbon Contracts \nCompany (the counterparty designated by the government) and none of them has \ntaken FID so far. A second allocation round is ongoing, with a target to support \nprojects with a total capacity of 875 MW. \nThe biggest electrolyser project currently under construction, the 2.2 GW NEOM \nGreen Hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia, took financial closure in May 2023 and \nplans to start operations in 2026. If this project is used as a proxy indicator, it would \nsuggest that the construction time required for a GW-scale plant is around 3 years \n(i.e. time between FID and beginning operation, although in the specific case of \nthe NEOM project, construction began a few months before the FID was reached). \nOf all the projects in the pipeline expected to start operation by 2030 and with size \nequal to or above 1 GW, only four plants (6 GW cumulatively) have already \nreached FID or are under construction. However, more than 50 projects, for a \ncombined capacity of 125 GW, are currently undergoing feasibility study. If they \ndo not reach FID and start construction by 2027, it is unlikely that they will begin \noperation by the end of the decade. This means that 25% of the total announced \ncapacity by 2030 is at significant risk of not beginning operation on time (55% if \nprojects at very early stages of development are excluded). \n32%\n2%\n43%\n20%\n3%\nEurope\nNorth America\nChina\nIndia\nRoW\n6.5 GW\n23%\n23%\n3%\n19%\n10%\n8%\n14%\nAmmonia\nMethanol\nRefinery\nOther industrial\nuses\nMethanol\nOther transport\nfuels\nOther/unknown\n6.5 GW\nIndustry\nTransport\nOther\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

The design of the overall system, in particular the sizing \nof the renewable electricity capacity relative to the electrolyser, will be critical for \nthe hydrogen production costs (Box 3.2).  \n \nBox 3.2 \nImpact of optimal sizing of renewable to electrolyser capacity \nFor renewables-based electrolysis projects, achieving high utilisation rates for the \nelectrolyser reduces the impact of the electrolyser CAPEX in the overall cost of \nhydrogen production. For directly connected projects, oversizing the renewable \ngeneration capacity relative to the capacity of the electrolyser can be a way to \nachieve this. This increases the CAPEX spending for renewable electricity \ngeneration, but it can help to minimise the overall hydrogen production costs by \nincreasing the utilisation rate of the electrolyser. Optimising the capacity ratio of \nthe renewable plant in combination with other design options such as combining \nsolar PV and wind in a hybrid configuration, and including electricity and/or \nhydrogen storage, can also lead to a more stable supply of hydrogen or industrial \nprocess, which also helps to improve the operation and economics of any \nsubsequent synthesis process. \nThrough the Energy Transformation PatHway Optimization Suite (ETHOS) model \nsuite, the optimal renewable-to-electrolyser ratio has been computed for several \nannounced project locations around the world, minimising the levelised cost of \nhydrogen (LCOH) production in each of those locations. For onshore wind, the \noptimal sizing factor is between 1 (such as in the case for locations that already \nhave relatively high capacity factors for wind) and 1.4 in Europe, slightly higher in \nthe United States and Canada, and in the range of 1.6-2.8 for Brazil. In the case \nof solar PV, this factor is between 1.3 and 1.7 in regions with excellent solar \nirradiation, such as Chile, Africa and the Middle East, while it reaches a value of 2 \nin Europe and up to 2.4 in certain locations in China. The optimisation does not \ntake into account other uses of the renewable electricity from the same plant; a \nhigher renewable-to-electrolyser capacity ratio could be expected from projects \nthat plan to use the same renewable electricity plant for multiple purposes besides \nhydrogen production. For example, the Puertollano Green Hydrogen project by \nIberdrola, which has a solar PV capacity of 100 MW to power a 20 MW \nelectrolyser, aims to send excess electricity to the local grid.  \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

This \nyear, the ETHOS modelling suite of the Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany has \nbeen used to determine for each project location the optimal sizing of the \nrenewable electricity capacity relative to the electrolyser capacity, taking into \naccount local hourly solar PV and wind profiles and region-specific technology \ncosts. The optimal capacity factors have been applied to projects using solar PV, \nonshore wind, offshore wind or planning to combine multiple renewables types, for \nwhich a hybrid configuration of solar PV and onshore wind has been selected; they \naccount for more than half of the 36 Mtpa that could be produced from electrolysis \nby 2030. This approach is particularly useful for those projects where no \ninformation on the planned renewable capacity has been released. In order to \nprovide values that are comparable with the previous editions of this report, the \nnon-optimised production, i.e. using a 1:1 capacity ratio between the renewable \nelectricity and the electrolyser capacities, is also provided.

CC BY 4.0. \nSource: IEA Hydrogen Production Projects Database (October 2024). \nAmong the announced projects for the production of hydrogen from electrolysis, \nseveral have announced the renewable capacity that will be used to power the \nfacility. The solar PV-to-electrolyser capacity ratio is, in many cases, between one \nand three, with some larger values in the case of projects in Europe. Similar values \ncan be derived for onshore wind in Europe, while the smaller sample for Australia \nand Latin America shows capacity ratios of one-and-a-half to two and three, \nrespectively. \nElectrolyser manufacturing  \nManufacturing capacity for assembling electrolyser systems had reached 25 GW/yr \nby the end of 2023, based on the nominal facility size from company announcements. \nThis has almost doubled compared to 2022, with nearly three-quarters of the new \nadditions in China, which accounted for 60% of capacity in 2023, and is expected to \nmaintain this share in the short term (Figure 3.7). Based on announcements that \nreached FID or are under construction, another 16 GW/yr of capacity could be added \nin 2024, to reach more than 40 GW/yr of global capacity. The largest share of new \nadditions would be in China, followed by Europe, which could potentially add more \nthan 3 GW/yr. However, based on an estimated output of 2.5 GW in 2023, this \nmanufacturing capacity is currently underutilised; in addition, reaching the assembly \ncapacity expansion envisaged by announced projects will depend on the scale-up of \nmanufacturing capacity of all the components in parallel, for which there is limited \nvisibility.  \nBy 2030, more than 165 GW/yr of capacity could be reached based on all \nannouncements – almost 30% of this announced capacity has reached FID, and \nanother 30% has been announced without a target year for starting operations. \nConsidering only the facilities that are expected to enter operation by 2030, the \nresulting capacity of 116 GW could meet almost two-thirds of the needs in the NZE \n0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n 10\nOversizing factor\nSolar PV\nOnshore wind\nOffshore wind\nEurope\nAustralia\nLatin America\n0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n 10\n0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n 10\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

China would continue to account for the largest share – 30% – of \nmanufacturing capacity in 2030, followed by Europe (with 20%) and the United States \n(15%). Around 7% of announcements, for a total 12 GW, were made without a \ndefined location, meaning that the regional distribution of global manufacturing \ncapacity could still change by 2030.  \nFigure 3.7 \nElectrolyser manufacturing capacity by region, 2022-2024e, and announced \ncapacity additions by region, technology and status, 2030 \n \nIEA.

As the Chinese market for electrolysers grows, it is attracting manufacturers \nfrom different business areas, such as Trina and Sungrow, who are both active in the \nsolar PV industry, and are now among the largest companies in terms of electrolyser \nmanufacturing capacity. The Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has obtained \na patent for electrolyser equipment, signalling that it also sees potential to enter the \nmarket. PEM announced capacity is concentrated mainly in Europe, with almost half \nof the 43 GW/yr by 2030, followed by North America and India, which together have \na fifth. The US-based manufacturer Accelera by Cummins has started production of \nits HyLIZER1000 in China, which with a 5-MW modular unit is the largest PEM \nelectrolyser in China in terms of single unit capacity.

For example, thyssenkrupp nucera \nhas expanded its product range by signing a strategic partnership with the German \nresearch centre Fraunhofer IKTS for commercialisation of the SOEC technology, and \nplans to open a pilot production line as soon as 2025. American energy service \ncompany Baker Hughes has invested in Elcogen, an Estonian SOEC and fuel cell \nmaker. In Denmark, Topsoe will supply the ammonia producer First Ammonia with a \n500 MW electrolyser, which should take up a big portion of the company’s 500 MW/yr \nfacility in Herning for the next couple of years before further scale-up. For the US \nmarket, a further 1 GW/yr manufacturing facility in Virginia has been announced by \nTopsoe. Another electrolyser technology that represents a very small share of current \nmanufacturing capacity, but that could reach more than 10% by 2030 if all the \nannouncements are realised, is anion exchange membrane (AEM). US-based \nEvolOH announced plans for a new facility in Lowell, Massachusetts. In addition, \nEnapter, which is one of the largest manufacturers of AEM electrolysers today, saw \nsales increase around fourfold between the last quarter of 2022 and the last quarter \nof 2023, confirming the interest of small-scale project developers in this technology. \nThe geography of electrolyser manufacturing \nBased on current manufacturing capacity, electrolyser orders and announcements for \nfuture expansions of facilities, Chinese companies are predominantly expanding \nmanufacturing capacity in China in order to meet domestic demand. Certain \nEuropean companies are also operating in the Chinese market, mainly through joint \nventures or agreements with Chinese companies, such as in the case of the Jigli plant \nin Suzhou being developed with Belgian company John Cockerill, or the partnership \nbetween Norwegian HydrogenPro and Tianjin Mainland in Tianjin. AEM electrolyser \nmanufacturer Enapter announced in 2024 a joint venture with the Chinese company \nWolong to move part of their production and assembly to China, though not the \nmanufacturing of the electrolyser stack itself. \nSimilarly, the largest European and North American electrolyser manufacturers \ntypically locate the majority of their capacity in their home regions (Figure 3.8) in order \nto serve domestic demand. In the European Union, the Net Zero Industry Act, with a \ngoal for manufacturing capacity to reach at least 40% of the European Union’s annual \ndeployment needs by 2030, could provide a long-term signal to manufacturers and \ninvestors. However, the expansion of some European companies to the United States \nhas been observed recently, thanks to attractive policies – such as the Inflation \nReduction Act (IRA), although the finalisation of the technical rules is still pending – \nfor the development of hydrogen projects that can create demand for electrolysers. \nInternational trade of electrolysers has been limited so far: of 1.4 GW of total installed \nwater electrolysers capacity as of 2023, less than 20% have been shipped \ninternationally. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 76  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nThere are some signs of change in the geographical distribution of manufacturing, \nalthough whether this will add up to a longer-term trend remains to be seen. Chinese \nelectrolyser manufacturer Guofu Hydrogen Energy Equipment (GuofuHee) \nannounced in 2023 the intention to open a factory in Germany by 2026. Trina \nHydrogen, which is headquartered in China, expects to take FID next year for a new \nfacility to be built in Spain, and the Chinese Hygreen Energy has announced in August \nthis year the plan for a facility in Spain together with local firm Coxabengoa. In 2024, \nSwedish company Metacon was granted rights to manufacture electrolysis systems \nbased on China-based PERIC’s technology. On the electrolyser supply side, the \nrecent results of the European Hydrogen Bank pilot auction show that up to 25% of \nthe projects might procure electrolysers from China based on the submitted letters of \nintent, while more than half intend to buy from domestic manufacturers in the \nEuropean Union. With a growing pipeline of electrolysis projects, and the ongoing \nexpansion in manufacturing capacity, trade in electrolysers could represent an \nopportunity for companies with capacity to enter new markets, especially in those \nregions where there is no manufacturing capacity today.41  \nFigure 3.8 \nElectrolyser manufacturing capacity by company headquarters, 2023, and \nby 2030  \n \nIEA.

In 2023, \nthe capital cost for an installed electrolyser (including the equipment, gas \ntreatment, plant balancing, and engineering, procurement and construction cost, \nand \ncontingencies) \nranged \nbetween \nUSD 2 000/kW \nfor \nalkaline \nand \nUSD 2 450/kW for PEM electrolysers (Figure 3.9). Alkaline electrolysers \nmanufactured in China are cheaper than those produced in Europe or North \nAmerica in terms of CAPEX, and can reach around USD 750/kW-1 300/kW for an \ninstalled system. Compared to the GHR 2023, the capital cost for 2023 has been \nrevised based on newly available data from more advanced projects and to include \ncontingency costs, resulting in an increase of about 20% (BNEF 2024, TNO 2024). \nFigure 3.9 \nElectrolyser cost based on current and announced projects and in the \nStated Policies and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenarios, 2023-2030, and \ncost disaggregation by component, 2023  \n \n IEA.

CC BY 4.0. \nThe cost of an installed electrolyser system can be divided into three main \ncomponents: the stack, the balance of plant and the installation cost. The stack \ncost represents about 50-60% of the uninstalled electrolyser system, with the rest \nbeing the power supply unit (including the rectifier), oxygen separator tank, \ncirculation pumps, piping, cooling system, valves, piping and various \ninstrumentation (which is usually referred to as the balance of plant (BoP)). On top \nof that, installation could account for up to half of the final installed cost. Based on \nbottom-up calculations and assuming a high utilisation rate of factories, the direct \ncost of manufacturing an alkaline electrolyser stack could range between USD 45-\n65/kW (with China at the lower end, and Europe and the United States at the \nhigher end). However, we estimate a low utilisation rate of electrolyser factories \ntoday, as demand has not yet scaled up and output was estimated at 2.5 GW in \n2023: with a low utilisation rate such as 10%, the manufacturing cost could \nincrease three- to fourfold, to USD 130-260/kW. \nBased on capacity increases envisaged by announced projects, mass \nmanufacturing and economies of scale – in particular to the stack – could lead to \na decrease in the capital cost of an installed electrolyser system, with costs \ndeclining by 40-50% by the end of the decade, and up to 55% if projects at an \nearly stage of development are also taken into account. This potential cost \nreduction is quite close to what is achieved in the NZE Scenario, with capital cost \ndown by 55-60% compared to 2023, and an installed capacity of 560 GW by the \nend of the decade. In the STEPS, by predominantly taking into account projects \nthat have at least reached FID, the cost reduction is much lower, at around 40% \nby 2030. \nFossil fuels with CCUS \nAbout 15 hydrogen facilities42 around the world are equipped with CCUS, with a \ncumulative capture capacity of around 12 Mtpa CO2. Most facilities are retrofitted \nhydrogen production units in refining and fertiliser production in North America, \nwith first operation dating from the early 1980s. Only around 1 Mtpa of the \ncaptured CO2 is injected in dedicated storage (at the Quest facility in Canada), \nand the remainder is injected for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or used in \napplications such as the food and drink industry, or for boosting yields in \ngreenhouses. Moreover, most facilities have been retrofitted with partial capture, \nmeaning only process emissions – which have a high concentration of CO2 – are \ncaptured. This results in only around 0.6 Mtpa H2 production qualifying as low- \n \n \n \n42 Only projects with a capture capacity above 100 000 t CO2 per year are considered here. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 79  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nemissions out of the 0.9-1.2 Mtpa produced43, with 0.35 Mtpa from natural gas \nreforming (4 Mtpa CO2 captured), and 0.3 Mtpa from coal and oil gasification \n(8 Mtpa CO2 per year captured).  \nHydrogen is one of the leading applications in CCUS deployment plans. More than \none-quarter of CO2 capture capacity under construction or in planning involves \nhydrogen or ammonia production across a range of applications, including \ndedicated production, refineries, fertiliser and iron and steel. In the United States, \nwhile CO2 demand for EOR was the primary driver for the first plants to capture \nemissions, the 45Q tax scheme first introduced in 2008 and increased through the \nIRA in 2022 up to USD 85 per tonne of CO2 stored (around USD 0.8/kg H244), and \nup to USD 60 per tonne of CO2 used (around USD 0.55/kg H2), along with \nUSD 7 billion in funding for the establishment of clean hydrogen hubs, continues \nto support development. The United States now accounts for almost half of low-\nemissions hydrogen production from fossil fuels with CCUS announced for 2030. \nAir Products recently announced its intention to apply for the 45Q tax credit for the \nEastern Louisiana Clean Hydrogen Complex to produce 0.7 Mtpa of hydrogen \ncapturing 5 Mtpa CO2. Projects producing low-emissions hydrogen from fossil \nfuels can also apply for the 45V tax credit (but not combine both tax credits), which \nprovides an incentive of up to USD 3/kg H2, depending on the CO2 emissions \nassociated with hydrogen production. However, it would be challenging for these \nprojects to reach the maximum reduction of CO2 intensity (0.45 kg CO2/kg H2) \nstipulated by the scheme, given that upstream emissions for the fossil fuel supply \nare included in the calculation of the carbon footprint. This would lead to a \nreduction in support. Moreover, there is still substantial uncertainty around the \napplication of the 45V tax credit, which is delaying multiple investment decisions, \naffecting not only single projects but also entire hubs.  \nIn Europe, CCUS-based hydrogen production announcements are concentrated \naround the North Sea area, which boasts access to both natural gas and CO2 \nstorage resources. The Netherlands is home to the most advanced CCUS-based \nhydrogen projects, with three projects that reached FID in 2023, planning to \nconnect to large CO2 transport and storage hubs under construction offshore of \nNorway and the Netherlands. The European Council approved in May 2024 a gas \nand hydrogen markets package, which set a deadline of 1 year from the package \nbeing signed into law for the European Commission to publish a Delegated Act \nspecifying the methodology for assessing GHG emissions savings from low-\ncarbon fuels (including hydrogen). This is expected to provide further regulatory \nclarity to project developers in the European Union. The United Kingdom currently \n \n \n43 Low-emissions hydrogen production is estimated from the plant CO2 capture capacity, and therefore only includes \nhydrogen production for which CO2 is captured and stored. The range of total hydrogen production is estimated assuming a \n40-60% overall unit capture rate for gas-based production and 90-95% for coal and oil-based production, including projects \ncapturing CO2 for utilisation. \n44 Assuming gas-based production, 0.9105 kg CO2 emitted per normal cubic metre (Nm3) H2 and 90% capture rate. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

In total, Europe could account for around 40% of low-emissions hydrogen \nproduction from fossil fuels with CCUS by 2030.45  \nIn Canada, the sector is benefiting from CCUS investment tax credits and is also \nlikely to benefit from the Clean Hydrogen Investment Tax Credits. The \ndevelopment of carbon storage hubs is advancing in the province of Alberta, with \none project that reached FID in June 2024. Projects in the Middle East are also \nprogressing. In May 2024, Fertiglobe announced an FID for a 1 Mtpa new \nammonia production facility in the United Arab Emirates, with plans to capture and \nstore CO2 from the facility in a second deployment phase that has not yet taken \nFID.  \nIf all announced projects are realised, low-emissions hydrogen production from \nfossil fuels with CCUS could increase eighteen-fold, from around 0.6 Mt H2 per \nyear in 2023 to 11 Mtpa H2 per year by 2030, or about 8 Mtpa H2 if projects at an \nearly stage of development are excluded (Figure 3.10). The vast majority comes \nfrom gas reforming, and less than 1 Mtpa H2 from coal or oil gasification. This is \nstill around 6 Mt H2 short of the circa 17 Mt of low-emissions hydrogen production \nfrom fossil fuels with CCUS needed in 2030 in the NZE Scenario.  \nProjects under development are likely to need further policy and financial support \nto come to fruition. To date, just over 10% of planned production for 2030 is \ncurrently at FID or under construction. However, the number of FIDs in hydrogen \nor ammonia production almost doubled between 2022 and 2023, indicating higher \ninvestor confidence in the sector. Hydrogen and ammonia production projects now \nmake up a third of all FIDs taken for CCUS-based projects in 2023.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n45 This could decrease to one-quarter if projects at a very early stage of development (e.g. only a co-operation agreement \namong stakeholders has been announced) are included. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

The hydrogen production cost from unabated natural gas \nwas estimated at USD 0.8-5.7/kg H2, similar to the cost prior to the energy crisis. \nHydrogen produced from unabated natural gas is generally cheaper than \nelectrolytic hydrogen today, but price volatility could remain a challenge. In \nEurope, the ratio between the maximum and minimum gas price (based on the \nTTF exchange) has been 13 in the last 2 years, and even the United States, which \nhas lower gas prices on average, had a price ratio (based on Henry Hub) of more \nthan 10 over the same period. \n \n0\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n 10\n 12\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024e\n2030\nMtpa H2\nOperational and planned low-emissions H₂ production \nfrom fossil fuels with CCUS\nEarly stage\nFeasibility\nFID\nOperational\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\n2023\n2030\nShare of operational and planned fossil-CCUS \nH₂ production\nRest of the world\nAustralia\nEurope\nChina\nMiddle East\nCanada\nUnited States\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

In Europe, electrolytic hydrogen production volume could reach nearly \n9 Mtpa (see Figure 3.12), but the majority of production from dedicated renewable \nelectricity would be realised at a cost above USD 4/kg H2 in both the STEPS and \nthe NZE Scenario. Based on the announced projects, only around 1 Mtpa could \nbe produced at a cost below the unabated natural gas route by 2030 in the NZE \nScenario, while more than half of the volume (12 Mtpa) would be at costs up to \nUSD 1.5/kg H2 more expensive than hydrogen from unabated natural gas: without \nadequate support closing the cost gap, these projects are likely not competitive \nwith the unabated fossil route (Figure 3.12). By considering only projects that are \noperational or have at least reached FID, only half a Mtpa could actually be \ncompetitive against the unabated fossil fuels route by 2030 in the NZE Scenario, \nand as little as 0.1 Mtpa in the STEPS. \nFigure 3.13 Hydrogen production cost from hybrid solar PV and onshore wind, and \nfrom offshore wind in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, 2030 \n \nIEA.

Production costs could fall below USD 2/kg H2 by 2030 in certain \nlocations. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 85  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nBased on the supply cost curve in Figure 3.12, more than half of the production \ncould be between USD 2/kg H2 and USD 4/kg H2 in the NZE Scenario, with \nAustralia and Latin America occupying the largest part of this range. However, the \nLCOH from renewable sources could fall even further and reach values below \nUSD 2/kg H2 in locations with excellent resources, and by considering a hybrid \nrenewable configuration. \nIn the NZE Scenario, hydrogen production could reach a levelised cost of around \nor below USD 2/kg H2 by 2030 in Argentinian and Chilean Patagonia, and in \ncertain parts of central China (Figure 3.13). In South America and India, a \ncombination of onshore wind and solar PV is the optimal configuration to reach a \nhigh capacity factor and keep production costs low (in the south of Argentina, \nthough, the share of solar PV is minimal as wind resources are excellent). \nProduction cost from offshore wind at around or below USD 3/kg H2 by 2030 could \nbe achieved in Northern Europe and the southern part of Patagonia, where high \ncapacity factors could be reached.  \nThe impact of low-emissions hydrogen on the cost of \nfinal products \nThe cost of producing renewable hydrogen today is generally between one and a \nhalf and six times higher than unabated fossil-based hydrogen production, \ndepending on the location. While this is expected to come down in the medium \nterm, the “green premium” associated with renewable hydrogen is substantial \ntoday, and can have an impact on the economic competitivity of certain sectors. \nThis cost premium is always a key consideration for the industrial sector in the \nproduction of materials and feedstocks, such as steel or ammonia, but a closer \nlook downstream at different steps of the supply chain in which these materials \nare used gives a perspective on how this green premium could be passed to the \nend user (or final consumer) of different products. Three examples are provided \nbelow. \nIn the food supply chain, low-emissions hydrogen can be used to produce low-\nemissions ammonia as a feedstock to produce nitrogen-based fertilisers, such as \nurea. Fertilisers are commonly used in agriculture to increase crop yields, with \ntheir cost having an impact on the final cost of agricultural products – and therefore \non the cost of food. Starting from a premium of 110-330% for renewable hydrogen \ntoday in China and Europe, respectively, the production cost of renewable \nammonia could be 40-200% more than for unabated fossil-based production. For \nthis step in the supply chain, it should be noted that in Europe, given high natural \ngas prices, domestic production of ammonia has reached very high values in \nrecent years, therefore reducing the gap with renewable-based ammonia \nproduction. In several cases, this led to a reduction in activity in the European \nfertiliser industry and a shift towards imports. By taking into account average \nfertiliser application and yields for wheat production by region, the impact on the \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 86  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nproduction costs for wheat goes down to 2% in China and to 5-10% in Europe and \nthe United States (Figure 3.14). While this may seem very low, the impact on \nfarmers’ finances is not negligible. Moving another step downstream in the supply \nchain to a commonly used product based on wheat, such as pasta, the premium \nfalls to under 1%. Numerous consumers in advanced economies can (and are \nwilling to) absorb this cost increase, but the situation in emerging markets and \ndeveloping economies (EMDEs) is completely different. Household budgets are \nvery low in EMDEs and sensitivity to food prices is much higher. Even small \nincreases in prices could put at risk food security. \nAnother commonly purchased product that could be affected by the “green \npremium” of renewable hydrogen is a flight ticket. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), \nwhich include synthetic kerosene, are needed to decarbonise the aviation sector, \nbut their cost today is 4-10 times higher than fossil kerosene. Producing synthetic \nkerosene in Europe, with a mix of renewables, has a premium compared to fossil \nkerosene that ranges from 840% in 2023 to 370% in 2030 and 320% in 2035 on \nthe basis of current policy settings (assuming a moderate cost reduction, in line \nwith the STEPS). By considering the SAF blending shares mandated in REFuelEU \nAviation, this translates into an increase in fuel cost of 13% in 2023, 8% in 2030 \nand 32% in 2035, which considering that fuel price usually represents 25-30% of \ntotal flight costs, translates into a ticket price increase in the range of 2% to 8%. \nThe increase between years 2030 and 2035 is due mainly to the increase in SAF \nshare to reach 20% SAF in 2035, of which 5% is synthetic kerosene.46  \nWith regards to industrial materials, low-emissions hydrogen is set to play a critical \nrole for decarbonisation in steelmaking. Steel, which is today responsible for about \n7% of energy sector CO2 emissions, is used in many different applications, \nincluding car manufacturing. Direct reduction of iron ore (DRI) with hydrogen, if \npowered by clean electricity, could reduce the direct emissions intensity of iron-\nbased steelmaking from more than 2 000 kg CO2 per tonne of crude steel to below \n400 kg CO2/kg steel if using 100% iron-based inputs, which would be compatible \nwith the IEA's definition for near zero emission steel. Producing low-emissions \nsteel today in China, Europe or the United States is 27-43% more expensive than \nproducing traditional steel. This premium goes down to only around 1% when \npassed to the final price of an electric vehicle (EV), by considering an average EV \nprice of USD 27 000 in China and USD 40 000 in Europe and the United States. \nIn general, at every additional step downstream in each supply chain, the premium \nis reduced due to additional cost components and margins of the different \nprocesses (which have been assumed to be constant, for simplicity). The impact \nof the premium cost of low-emissions hydrogen on commonly used final products \n \n \n46 The ReFuelEU aviation regulation does not mandate synthetic kerosene use before 2030. For the year 2023, the 2030 \nmandate has been used for illustrative purposes. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 87  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \ntherefore falls to just a few percentage points in all the examples analysed, even \nwhen starting from today’s high production costs. \nThere are some premium markets where consumers could be willing to accept this \nsmall green premium, and even more if they have sustainability goals. \nGovernments have an opportunity to implement policies that stimulate markets for \nthese end products through public procurement, to reduce emissions in these \nsectors, which can, in turn, generate demand for low-emissions hydrogen. \nHowever, the consequences of these policies on stakeholders right across the \nvalue chains would need to be carefully assessed, with significant implications for \npolicy design.  \nDifferent end users can be expected to respond to these small price increases in \ndifferent ways. In the case of flights, a small premium can be relatively easily \nabsorbed by clients, in particular those flying in business class, or by large \ncorporations that have already taken action by buying SAF certificates (see \nChapter 2. Hydrogen demand). In the case of cars, the willingness to pay the \ngreen premium has already been proven in the EV market and is slowly being \nreflected in the growing number of offtake agreements for steel produced with low-\nemissions hydrogen from carmakers. However, the case of food products is very \ndifferent: Price increases can be easily absorbed by the wealthiest individuals, but \ncan have a significant impact on the personal budgets of a large share of the \npopulation, as has been seen in the recent inflationary period. This impact can be \nparticularly serious in certain countries, particularly Africa, where it could even put \nat risk food security, due to the limited availability of the majority of the population \nto absorb price increases. Care should be taken in designing these measures to \nprotect the most price-sensitive products and consumers while still making \nprogress on decarbonising these industries. In addition, there are more factors to \nweigh in when considering public procurement in this sector. Previous experience \nshows that policies to incentivise fertiliser adoption have led to imbalanced and \ninefficient use. In the case of the food value chain, focusing public procurement \npolicies on the end product (e.g. food purchases for schools, food banks or military \nbases) could help to avoid past policy failures. Procurement practices could also \nbe adopted by the private sector, in the same way as for flight tickets. However, \nthis would require the development of reliable systems of certificates and labels to \nprovide certainty to consumers about the low-emission attributes of the end \nproducts they are acquiring, which can lead to additional bureaucratic burden.  \nFinally, farmers and manufacturers further up in the value chain are strongly \nimpacted by cost increases, as their products are globally traded in highly \ncompetitive markets, where they operate with slim margins. They may be too far \nremoved from the end consumers to be able to benefit from their willingness to \npay a premium. Governments designing policies to stimulate these premium \nmarkets will need to take a holistic view of the value chain in order to mitigate any \nrisks to stakeholders. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 89  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nThe role of water for hydrogen production \nHydrogen production today uses about 1.5 billion cubic metres (m3) of freshwater, \nrepresenting less than 5% of the energy sector's total water consumption. \nHowever, for future development of the hydrogen sector, it will be fundamental to \ntake local water dynamics into account. Hydrogen production pathways differ with \nregards to water use for feedstock and cooling. The electrolysis process requires \nabout 10 litres of water per kilogramme of hydrogen (l/kg H2) for feedstock and a \ntotal 30-70 l/kg H2 for feedstock and cooling, depending on the electrolyser \ntechnology and the local climate conditions. Producing hydrogen via steam \nmethane reforming requires a total of 16-40 l/kg H2, with cooling being responsible \nfor the majority of this: water use for feedstock in the steam methane reforming \nprocess accounts for about 5 l/kg H2. The water requirement scales notably when \nthe facilities integrate CCUS technologies, and can become even higher than for \nelectrolysis. \nVarious water sources could be used, such as groundwater, surface water, \nwastewater and seawater. Water stress in numerous regions worldwide \nnecessitates increased investments in desalination plants for the use of seawater. \nThe global installed capacity of desalination plants stands at approximately \n145 million m3 per day, nearly twice what it was in 2010. Desalination plants \ncurrently operate in approximately 45 countries worldwide, including China, Saudi \nArabia, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and the United States, which together \ncover more than half of the global installed capacity.  \n \nBox 3.3 \nDefining water metrics \nIt is essential to distinguish between water “withdrawal” and “consumption” when \ndefining water metrics, as they represent two different aspects of water use. \nUnderstanding the difference between these two metrics is crucial for accurate \nreporting and sustainable water management. \n \nWater withdrawal: refers to the total amount of water extracted from a source \nfor use, i.e. surface water (lake, river), groundwater (including rainwater), \nseawater. After use, some or all of this water might be returned to the source \n(water discharge). \n \nWater discharge: refers to the return of water to natural sources after it has \nbeen used in various processes. This can include treated wastewater, cooling \nwater from industrial processes, or run-off from agricultural fields. \n \nWater consumption: represents the portion of the withdrawn water that is not \nreturned back to the initial water source. It is the water that is absorbed, \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 90  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nevaporated, or incorporated into products or processes, meaning it is no longer \navailable for reuse in its original form. Put simply: Water consumption = Water \nwithdrawal – Water discharge. \n \nAdvances and solutions for water supply in hydrogen projects \nWater scarcity could pose a challenge to hydrogen projects, especially in \nrenewable-rich but water-stressed areas. Regions that currently do not face water \nstress might also be at risk in future due to increases in droughts caused by climate \nchange. For this reason, it will be important for hydrogen projects to use different \nwater sources and take care of their sustainable management. Based on the \nannounced projects, around 40% of the global low-emissions electrolytic hydrogen \nproduction by 2030 is located in water-stressed regions (Figure 3.15).  \nWater shortages could mean that hydrogen projects face disruptions or \ncancellations. Developers in various regions are therefore exploring large-scale \ndesalination of seawater, or use of treated wastewater, to ensure an adequate \nwater supply for their projects. For instance, the NEOM project plans to address \nits water needs through a desalination plant powered entirely by renewable \nenergy, boasting a production capacity of 500 000 m3 of desalinated water per \nday. This plant will meet 30% of NEOM’s forecasted total water demand, including \nall the water needs for hydrogen production. Similarly, in South Australia, \ndevelopment agreements have been signed with five companies for hydrogen \ndevelopment, including plans for a large desalination plant with a capacity of \n260 000 m3 per day on the Eyre Peninsula, known as the Northern Water project. \nAdditionally, desalination plants are also in the pipeline for several other hydrogen \nprojects, indicating a trend towards integrating desalination into various \ndevelopment schemes to ensure water sustainability. Examples include a new \nhydrogen plant in Peru, aiming to produce 80 kt H2 per year; the project of ACWA \nPower located in Tunisia; the Nour and Aman projects in Mauritania; a project \nlocated in the Port of Pecém (Brazil) and many others in Morocco, Namibia, Oman \nand the United Arab Emirates. \n \n \n \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

CC BY 4.0. \nproject; RWE in the H2OpZee floating project in the North Sea and in the \nAquaVentus project; LHyfe in the HOPE project; and many others.  \nDesalination plant costs represent only a minor portion (less than 2%) of overall \nhydrogen project expenses. The process of reverse osmosis seawater \ndesalination requires around 3-6 kWh of electricity per m3 of water, resulting in a \ncost for hydrogen production of around USD 0.05/kg H2. In certain cases, \ndevelopers could oversize desalination capacity to ensure ample freshwater \nsupply for the project and surrounding areas, benefiting agriculture, industry and \ndomestic users. This approach provides community benefits with limited impact \non the economics of the hydrogen production project itself. \nSeawater can be useful in coastal areas facing water scarcity, but seawater \ncooling and brine discharge from desalination can cause thermal pollution and \nenvironmental impacts. Thorough assessment and management are needed to \nminimise these impacts on the ecosystem and ensure that desalination in coastal \nareas is sustainable. The NEOM project will use brine as feedstock for minerals \nand metals production, aiming for 100% Zero Liquid Discharge in downstream \nbrine industries.  \nAround 70% of the low-emissions hydrogen production in 2030 from announced \nprojects using water electrolysis is within 100 km from the coast, so that seawater \ndesalination is a viable option. Also, for projects more distant from the coast \nseawater desalination can be an option, but they require long-distance pipelines \nto transport the desalinated water. In water-stressed regions, more than 40% of \nthe low-emissions electrolytic hydrogen production in 2030 is at locations more \nthan 100 km off the coast (Figure 3.16). Experience in long-distance pipeline \ntransport of water exists today, though not in combination with desalination plants. \nThe longest freshwater pipeline in operation today transports in Australia water \nover 560 km from Perth to Kalgoorlie. The costs for long-distance water transport \nby pipeline depend not only on distance, but also on any elevation that needs to \nbe overcome. Costs can vary from USD 0.15 per m3 and 100 km in flat terrain to \nUSD 1 per m3 and 100 km in terrain with high mountains. Assuming transport \ncosts of USD 0.5 per m3 for a distance of 100 km, this would correspond to \nUSD 0.025/kg H2 (assuming water needs of 50 l/kg H2) \n \n \n \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

In water stressed regions, more than 40% \nare at locations more than 100 km off the coast. \nEffective thermal management in hydrogen production can reduce water needs \nand minimise environmental impacts. Efficient hydrogen production technologies \ngenerate less waste heat, reducing cooling demands and water use – research \nshows a 1% increase in electrolysis efficiency cuts water intensity by 2%. \nAlternative cooling technologies, such as dry cooling, fogging systems, adiabatic \npads systems for Air Fin Coolers, and Tundracel closed-loop cooling tower \nsystems, also offer the potential to reduce water requirements compared to \ntraditional wet cooling methods. Researchers at the University of Adelaide and \nStanford University have made progress on generating clean hydrogen through \nthe electrolysis of untreated seawater, and the sHYp company has already \npatented a membrane-less electrolyser to produce hydrogen from seawater. In \naddition, Chinese state-owned Dongfang Electric produced hydrogen directly from \nseawater on a floating offshore pilot plant. This technology is still at a very early \nstage, but could have significant implications, allowing hydrogen producers to \nbypass potential disruptions to local freshwater supplies by utilising abundant \nseawater without the need for extensive desalination facilities. \nSeveral projects for the production of low-emissions hydrogen for steelmaking \nhave been announced, some of them in areas with water stress, such as North \nAfrica or Namibia.

The \npotential for water conservation adds another aspect of sustainability to the \nhydrogen-based DRI process, beyond reducing carbon emissions. \nCountries with water-stressed regions have also introduced legislation that sets \nconditions for water usage for hydrogen production. For example, Egypt has \nunveiled a bill offering incentives for electrolytic hydrogen production sourced from \ndesalinated water generated using renewable energy. These incentives will be \nextended to desalination plants and renewable power facilities that allocate at \nleast 95% of their output to hydrogen plants. Brazil has introduced a bill prioritising \nthe use of desalinated water for hydrogen production, as well as rainwater and the \nnon-potable reuse of wastewaters. \nEmerging production routes \nNatural hydrogen \nNatural hydrogen can be generated through multiple routes, such as biological \nreactions, geothermal activity, serpentinisation and radiolysis, among others, and \nthe characteristics of the gas generated, such as its purity, will often depend on \nthe route of generation. Exploration and development of natural hydrogen has \nbeen gathering steam during the past years, and in the following section we briefly \nsummarise the progress made. Nevertheless, as of August 2024, there are no \nnatural hydrogen wells that have demonstrated commercial feasibility. \nTable 3.1 \nSelected surveys, databases and research activities on natural hydrogen \nInstitution \nCountry \nDescription \nGeological Survey of Canada \nCanada \nBuilding a database of potential deposits \n(started in 2022). \nInstitut National de la Recherche \nScientifique (INRS) \nCanada \nFirst province-scale survey (1.5 million km2) \nof potential source rocks for hydrogen. \nAdditional discoveries in collaboration with \nQuebec Innovative Materials Corp. at Ville \nMarie. \nU.S. Geological Survey  \nUnited States \nA national geological map for natural \nhydrogen. \nH2NA project \nFrance \nGeological mapping for the Nouvelle \nAquitaine region, with an industrial \nconsortium and French Geological Survey \nBRGM (since 2021). \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

Identification of source rocks, migration pathways, \nreservoirs and traps are followed by commercial feasibility checks, such as flow-\ntests, economic viability assessments and obtention of a licence to operate. Given \nthe growing interest in this potential route for producing low-emissions hydrogen, \nseveral organisations and research institutions have launched geological surveys \nto identify the potential hydrogen resources available underground in numerous \ncountries (Table 3.1). \nThe world’s only documented hydrogen producer well is in Bourakébougou, Mali, \nwith a production rate of about 1 500 m3 per day, or 0.1 tonnes of hydrogen per \nday. To put this in context, the US Department of Energy (DoE) Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) targets deposit production (from \nformation) rates of at least 30 000 tonnes of hydrogen per year. This is roughly \nequivalent to an electrolyser with 170 MW capacity operating for about 5000h/yr, \nor about 15-30% production of a typical steam methane reformer (SMR) plant.  \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

Exploration is underway in Albania, \nAustralia, Canada, Colombia, France, Finland, Korea, Spain and the \nUnited States (Table 3.2). Canada-based producer Hydroma claims to be \nextracting natural hydrogen at an estimated cost of USD 0.5/kg H2 in a \ncommercially favourable site in Mali (i.e. very shallow wells [~100 m], nearly pure \nhydrogen). In Spain and Australia, developers report aiming for a cost of about \nUSD 1/kg H2, depending on the deposit's depth and purity. Production tax \nsubsidies provided by the US IRA also have the potential to make this production \nroute more economically viable in the United States. Nevertheless, the technical \nmaturity of natural hydrogen is currently estimated to be at Technology Readiness \nLevel (TRL) 5.  \nSeveral countries have altered their laws and regulations to encourage exploration \nfor natural hydrogen, but it features explicitly in only 3 of the 60 hydrogen \nstrategies published so far. In Europe, an amendment to Poland’s Geological and \nMining Law, made in September 2023, provides the legal framework for the \nexploration and recognition of natural hydrogen fields. In France, natural hydrogen \nis considered to be an important pillar of the National Hydrogen Strategy, and the \ncountry aims to be a pioneer for the production of natural hydrogen. In February \n2024, the Philippines opened an auction for the rights to explore for natural \nhydrogen across two zones around 200 km from the capital city, Manila.  \nAustralia passed a bill to enable exploration for naturally occurring hydrogen in \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3. Hydrogen production \nPAGE | 98  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nMay 2024. Furthermore, additional legislative support has been offered in South \nAustralia, where one-third of the state is already covered by natural hydrogen \nexploration permits that have either been requested or granted. Elsewhere in the \nworld, though, the legal framework is less clear, and the landscape is evolving \nfast. \nOther emerging routes \nHydrogen can be produced from solid biomass through biological, thermochemical \nor electrochemical conversion. The hydrogen yield is the highest for \nthermochemical processes like gasification, pyrolysis, and reforming, which can \nproduce 40-190 kg H2 per tonne of feedstock,47 while biological processes like \nfermentation and anaerobic digestion only achieve around one-quarter of those \nyields (5-50 kg H2 per tonne of feedstock). The energy efficiency of most of these \nprocesses is 40-67% (lower heating value). Thermal and thermochemical \nconversion, which have the highest TRL, can achieve costs as low as \nUSD 1.2-2.4/kg H2, but on average are closer to USD 4.5-7/kg H2. Biological and \nelectrochemical processes have the dual challenge of a low TRL and higher \nproduction costs, in the range of USD 1.7-4.5/kg H2. Production from biomass can \nlead to CO2 removal on a lifecycle basis when the CO2 captured during hydrogen \nproduction is coupled with underground storage. The choice to produce from \nbiomass will be influenced by the hydrogen application; for example, in the \ntransport sector it might be cheaper to use the biomass (products) directly. \nIn China, there were fewer than ten operating gasification plants for hydrogen \nproduction in 2023, though several additional plants are under preparation. A \n2.2 ktpa plant in Guangdong province (China) started operating in 2023. This uses \nsteam reforming of biogas from food waste. The estimated investment was \nCHN 92 million (Yuan renminbi) (~USD 13 million). The targeted application is \nroad transport, with Foshan city having almost 1 000 hydrogen buses and over \n500 fuel cell electric vehicles in operation. Another 200 Nm3/hr bioethanol \nreforming plant in China also started operating in 2023. \nIn Europe, the Fuel Cell Tractor Fuelled with Biogenic Hydrogen (FCTRAC) project \nin Austria aims to demonstrate hydrogen separation from syngas that comes from \ndecentralised wood combined heat and power, biogas and sewage treatment \nplants for application in fuel cell tractors, and started its demonstration phase in \nQ3 2023. In the Netherlands, the Fuse Reuse Recycle project is targeting FID in \n2024 for a project to convert non-recyclable municipal waste (half of it consisting \nof biogenic material) to hydrogen. The hydrogen will be used in the nearby \nChemelot industrial park. The project had previously received about \n \n \n47 This can vary widely depending on the feedstock and the technology. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

Under the \nsecond phase of Mission Innovation, Italy approved around USD 39 million for \nbiohydrogen (among other technologies), to be spent across 2024-2026. The \nEuropean Investment Bank will provide free financial advisory to Plagazi (a waste-\nto-hydrogen company) for project development in Köping Hydrogen Park \n(Sweden). This project is sized for 51 MW of hydrogen production, with a total \ninvestment of about USD 140 million, and aims to start operation in 2025. In the \nUnited States, the DoE awarded USD 8.7 million to seven research projects \ncovering biomass gasifiers, modular designs, techno-economic analysis, and air \nseparation. The DoE also issued a request for information on industry capability \nfor gasification technologies, industry experience and modelling methods. \nHydrogen-based fuels and feedstock \nProject developments and outlook to 2030 \nTotal production of hydrogen-based fuels and feedstocks is expected to grow by \nalmost 15% in 2024, to reach a total of almost 0.5 million tonnes of hydrogen \nequivalent per year (Mtpa H2-eq) (Figure 3.17), on the basis of announced projects \nthat have at least reached FID. This volume represents 70% of the total low-\nemissions hydrogen production by 2023, but only a small fraction of global annual \nhydrogen production today of 97 Mt H2. Almost all of the year-on-year growth \ncomes from ammonia production projects. Almost three-quarters of the new \nammonia capacity that is expected to be commissioned during 2024 is located in \nChina, 20% in the Middle East, and most of the remainder in Europe. Over half of \nthe capacity located in China comes from just two projects in Inner Mongolia. \nMethanation capacity has remained nearly stable, with the biggest project to have \nadvanced beyond demonstration stage being the Great Plain Synfuels plant with \na capacity of 125 ktpa H2 – representing 99% of methanation capacity operating \ntoday. \nThe outlook for hydrogen-based fuels or feedstock based on announced projects \nadds up to nearly 10 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen production by 2030 \n(20 Mtpa if projects at very early stages of development are included). However, \nonly 7% has taken FID, is under construction, or is operational (13% if excluding \nprojects at very early stages of development). Nearly 85% of the project pipeline \nhas ammonia as a targeted product. If all the announced capacity comes to \nfruition, it would be equivalent to 50% of current global ammonia production. The \nnumber of projects targeting the production of synthetic methanol, as a feedstock \nor fuel, is much lower, equivalent to 5 Mtpa of methanol by 2030, or almost 4% of \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

All the announced projects for Fischer-Tropsch \n(FT) fuel production could produce 1.8 Mtpa H2-eq. by the end of the decade, \nequal to 1.6% of the aviation sector jet fuel demand in 2023. Smaller still, the full \nproject pipeline for synthetic methane to 2030 would be equivalent to less than \n0.02% of global natural gas production in 2023. Projects for hydrogen-based fuels \nand feedstocks are widely distributed across the world, with North America and \nAustralia having 25% each, and Europe and Latin America each with around 11% \nof 2030 announced output. The project pipeline could meet a significant share of \nregional hydrogen demand, should all the projects materialise (Figure 3.18).  \nFigure 3.17 Projects for hydrogen-based fuels and feedstocks by product, 2020-2024, \nand announced projects by product, region and status, 2030 \n \nIEA.

Australia, India, Indonesia and Mexico are the \nregions with most projects still at early stages of development. A large share of \nthe low-emissions ammonia is expected to be for export, with ammonia being the \nmost favoured hydrogen carrier for international trade (Chapter 4.

Even these would only equate to 1.1-1.5 Mtpa H249 of demand by 2035.50 \nIn 2023, the cost of electrolytic ammonia (NH3) production was nearly triple the \naverage production cost from fossil fuels (Figure 3.19). This is driven by the high \ninvestment cost of the assets. This also means that the cost of electrolytic \npathways is largely fixed over the asset lifetime, in contrast to the incumbent fossil-\nbased routes where the dominant cost is the fuel subject to price volatility. The \nelectrolyser represents 90% of the total plant CAPEX and it can alone be more \nthan the average fossil-based ammonia price of USD 560/t NH3, with additional \noperating costs, electricity consumption for compression and synthesis, and profit \nmargins, translating into a price premium. CAPEX is the main cost driver today, \nwith electricity becoming the dominant factor as the technology is deployed. \nProduction costs are dependent on deployment rather than a fixed timeline. In the \nmost optimistic scenario, production costs could decrease by 30-50% by 2030 in \nthe NZE Scenario, largely driven by a 60% drop in the CAPEX of the electrolyser, \nwhich is, in turn, driven by a cumulative electrolyser capacity of 560 GW and \ncontinuous innovation. Other cost reductions come from the massive deployment \nof solar PV and wind, and from a potential improvement of 3-4 percentage points \nin electrolyser efficiency.51 All these factors combined are sufficient to close the \ncost gap with unabated fossil-based ammonia. At the other extreme, in the \nSTEPS, electrolyser deployment could be an order of magnitude lower, at 50 GW, \nleading to a cost reduction of about 25-40% by 2030. For ammonia produced from \nnatural gas with CCUS, a gas price of USD 50/MWh (which was close to the \naverage price for Europe in 2023) would lead to a cost contribution of nearly \nUSD 500/t NH3 just from the fuel cost52. \nFor synthetic kerosene, similar drivers are behind the cost breakdown and \nexpected cost reduction to 2030, but substantial differences result from the CO2 \nfeedstock cost: there is a wide range of costs from point-source capture, \ndepending on the CO2 concentration in the stream. For concentrated streams, like \nthose from ethanol production, ethylene oxide and natural gas processing, the \ncosts are USD 15-35/t CO2, while for more diluted streams, like the flue gas from \npower generation, the costs can be USD 50-100/t CO2. The upper bound for the \nCO2 cost is defined by direct air capture (DAC) which can be as wide as USD 100-\n1 000/t CO2 based on literature and providers’ cost estimates. Using fossil-based \nCO2 can only lead to certain degree of CO2 reduction, but not to a carbon neutral \n \n \n49 1% target for shipping with a 2x multiplier (so half of the energy actually needs to be delivered, and the target is not yet \nmandatory) until the end of 2033. Range mainly depends on the uptake of energy efficiency rather than fuel mix. Value \nincludes the hydrogen demand for other synthetic products besides kerosene.  \n50 FuelEU Maritime establishes a conditional 2% RFNBO target by 2034 if a 1% RFNBO target is not reached by 2031, which \nis assumed to be the same by 2035, to be able to combine it with the 2035 ReFuelEU target of 5% of synthetic kerosene. \n51 This does not consider the emergence of disruptive electrolysis technologies which could offer larger improvements. \n52 The correlation between natural gas and hydrogen prices could be partially broken by using electricity to achieve the high \ntemperatures in steam reforming and using the natural gas only for the feedstock. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 3.

GHG emissions of hydrogen and its \nderivatives). By 2030, DAC costs could decrease by 40%, driven by a reduction \nin CAPEX and lower costs for the energy input. This cost decrease is not certain, \nand will depend on the learning from deployment and material costs. Moreover, it \ndiffers significantly depending on the scenario, since DAC deployment is driven \nby deep decarbonisation. The CO2 feedstock is a key cost driver for synthetic \nkerosene (Figure 3.19). These two parameters are directly proportional to each \nother, and for every USD 100/t change in CO2 feedstock costs, the production of \nsynthetic kerosene changes by nearly USD 55/bbl – a value that is equivalent to \n70% of the average WTI oil price from the first half of 2024. \nFigure 3.19 Levelised costs of ammonia and synthetic kerosene for electricity-based \npathways in 2023 and in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario in 2030  \n \nIEA.

Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 104  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \nHighlights \n \nHydrogen trade remains minimal and mainly limited to small-scale, localised \ntransport between neighbouring countries, and trade in hydrogen-based \nproducts such as ammonia or methanol. In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 \nScenario (NZE Scenario), interregional trade in hydrogen and hydrogen-based \nfuels reaches more than 70 Mt in hydrogen-equivalent terms (Mt H2-eq) by 2050, \nrepresenting almost 20% of global low-emissions hydrogen demand in that year.  \n \nIf all announced projects come to fruition, export-oriented projects could account \nfor 16 Mtpa H2-eq, or about one-third of low-emissions hydrogen production by \n2030. The amount has increased only marginally since the Global Hydrogen \nReview 2023, indicating that production projects announced in the past year \nmainly focus on domestic markets. The announced volume still highlights the \npotential for an international market, though uncertainties persist. As much as \n11 Mtpa H2-eq of this is still at very early stages of development, and a further \n5 Mtpa H2-eq is undergoing feasibility study.  \n \nAmmonia accounts for 85% of the trade from announced projects, reflecting the \nchemical industry’s existing experience in shipping ammonia. Australia and the \nUnited States combined could account for 10 Mtpa H2-eq of exports in 2030, \nwhile most projects (75%) target Europe as an import market. \n \nAnnounced new pipeline projects could reach nearly 40 000 km by 2035 – which \nis almost in line with needs in the NZE Scenario, though only 2% have reached \nfinal investment decision (FID). Infrastructure development is a capital-\nintensive, lengthy process, meaning planning must start early. Several pipeline \nprojects got underway in the past year, but progress on others is slow.  \n \nPipelines are the most cost-effective transport option, particularly for large \nvolumes, but shipping can be cheaper over longer distances. This would require \nnew port infrastructure and suitable tankers. On the basis of announced \nprojects, more than 100 new hydrogen and ammonia terminals and port \ninfrastructure projects could be realised by the end of the decade, on multiple \ncontinents. More than half of these projects are new ammonia export terminals. \n \nDespite recent project announcements, planned underground hydrogen storage \ncapacities – 10 TWh by 2035 and 40 TWh by 2050 – fall far short of the \nrequirements of the NZE Scenario, in which more than 230 TWh is required by \n2035. By 2050, the need for hydrogen storage in the NZE Scenario may reach \n410 bcm, a volume comparable to natural gas storage infrastructure today. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 105  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nOverview \nToday, hydrogen is mostly produced where it is needed, with limited quantities \ntransported over a few hundred kilometres by truck or pipeline. While some pure \nhydrogen is transported between neighbouring countries via interconnecting \npipelines, and there is trade in hydrogen-based products such as ammonia or \nmethanol, hydrogen trade remains minimal overall. However, hydrogen trade has \nthe potential to play an important role in the transition to a sustainable, secure and \naffordable energy system. Countries with ample resources for low-emissions \nhydrogen production that is more than sufficient to meet domestic needs could \nbenefit economically from exporting hydrogen and products produced from \nhydrogen, once domestic demand has been met. Countries with limited domestic \nresources for low-emissions hydrogen production at low costs could import the \nhydrogen needed to decarbonise their energy systems and reduce their reliance \non fossil fuels, and could also improve their energy security by diversifying the mix \nof supply countries for hydrogen imports. \nThe development of hydrogen markets, underpinned by trade, will require \ninfrastructure for transporting and storing hydrogen. For pure hydrogen, this is \nmore complex – and therefore more costly – than transporting and storing fossil \nfuels, given that hydrogen in gaseous form has a lower energy density per volume \nunit, and a lower liquefaction temperature than natural gas. Compression and \nliquefaction of hydrogen reduce its volumetric energy density for transport and \nstorage, as does converting hydrogen into carriers such as ammonia or liquid \norganic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) that are subsequently dehydrogenated to \nsupply pure hydrogen. Choosing which option to pursue largely depends on cost \nconsiderations, but is also influenced by the extent to which existing infrastructure \nfor handling fossil fuels could be repurposed for hydrogen. \nIn addition, or as an alternative to trading hydrogen or hydrogen carriers, countries \ncan economically benefit by producing and exporting higher-value products made \nwith low-emissions hydrogen. These products include ammonia, other nitrogen-\nbased fertilisers, methanol or synthetic fuels for which handling infrastructure and \ndemand already exist.  \nStatus and outlook of hydrogen trade \nIn the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), interregional \ntrade53 in hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels reaches more than 70 Mtpa in \n \n \n53 Interregional trade refers to the transport of hydrogen and hydrogen-derived fuels among regions covered by the Global \nEnergy and Climate Model, but not among countries within the same region. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 106  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nhydrogen-equivalent terms (Mtpa H2-eq) by 2050, representing almost 20% of \nglobal low-emissions hydrogen demand in that year. \nHydrogen trade flows are today minimal, and little changed since the publication of \nthe Global Hydrogen Review 2023 (GHR 2023) in September 2023. There are some \ncross-country hydrogen pipelines connecting industrial areas in Belgium, France \nand the Netherlands, but these are all relatively small in size and connect users \nlocated close to one another. However, there are a few pilot projects aiming to \ndemonstrate the potential for shipping hydrogen, and ammonia and methanol are \nalready traded internationally as feedstocks for the chemical industry. Around 10% \nof global ammonia demand and 20% of global methanol demand is met through \ninternational trade, almost entirely transported by ship. Between 1981 and February \n2022, a 2 500 km international ammonia pipeline was in operation between Togliatti \nin Russia and the port of Odesa in Ukraine, but operations were suspended after \nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the pipeline was damaged in June 2023.  \nRecent trade projects \nInternational shipping of hydrogen using an LOHC was first demonstrated in 2020 \nfrom Brunei Darussalam to Japan using tank containers, and again in 2022 along \nthe same route, but this time in a chemical tanker. A first cargo of liquefied \nhydrogen (LH2) was shipped in 2022 from Australia to Japan, and two further \nshipments took place in 2022 and 2024. \nMore recently, notable projects include several cargoes of low-emissions \nammonia shipped in 2023 and 2024, mainly from the Middle East to Asia and \nEurope (Table 4.1). However, traded volumes are still at a small scale and the \ndefinition of low-emissions ammonia varies. The ammonia shipments of the Saudi \nArabian fertiliser producers Ma’aden and SABIC Agri-Nutrients were certified by \nTÜV Rheinland as using “blue” hydrogen54 (138 kt NH3 for Ma’aden and 37.8 kt \nNH3 for SABIC Agri-Nutrients). An ammonia shipment from the United Arab \nEmirates to Japan in 2024 was certified as low-carbon by TÜV SÜD. Ammonia \nproduced from renewable electricity in Egypt and certified under International \nSustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) Plus was shipped to India in 2023. \nA further shipment of ISCC Plus-certified ammonia produced from biomethane \nand municipal waste took place in 2023 from the Netherlands to Germany. \nIn early 2024, DNV certified 614 kt NH3 of Ma’aden’s production as ultra low-\ncarbon ammonia, which requires an 80% reduction of GHG emissions compared \nto unabated fossil production. No details have been announced on potential \nofftakers for this certified ammonia to date. \n \n \n54 See Explanatory notes annex for the use of the term “blue” hydrogen in this report. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4.

Projects characterised as “low-carbon” or “blue” \nammonia or hydrogen are included, although information on the emission reduction compared to the unabated production \nfrom fossil fuels is not always available. TÜV Rheinland certification requires a CO2 emissions reduction by at least 30% by \ncapturing CO2 and storing it, or chemically or minerally fixing it for at least 25 years. TÜV SÜD certification requires at least \na 70% GHG emissions reduction compared to a benchmark intensity of 94 kg CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) per GJ of ammonia. \nThe ISCC PLUS certifications for OCI Global and Fertiglobe required GHG emissions being at least 70% and 73%, \nrespectively, lower compared to production with fossil fuels. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4.

Of this, less than a third has a potential offtaker among the project \npartners – an area where lack of progress was already observed in the GHR 2023. \nThe share of committed volume, i.e. projects that have at least reached FID or are \nunder construction, is still very low, at less than 3% of the total volume that could \nbe traded by 2030 (or less than 9% if projects at an early stage of development \nare excluded). As much as 70% of the potential volume to be exported by 2030 \nnot only has not yet reached FID, but also has no potential offtaker among the \nproject partners. \nFigure 4.1 \nLow-emissions hydrogen trade by status and by carrier based on \nannounced projects, 2030-2040 \n \nIEA.

CC BY 4.0. \nNote: “Not defined” refers to projects for which the import destination has not been disclosed. \nSource: IEA analysis based on multiple sources, including company announcements.  \nAustralia and the United States could become the largest exporters by 2030, and Europe \nthe largest importer, although over half of all production has no defined import destination. \nAmmonia is the most frequently chosen carrier, accounting for 85% of the trade \nfrom announced projects. This is due to the already developed international trade \nmarket and existing shipping infrastructure for ammonia as feedstock for the \nchemical industry. In addition, at the import side, ammonia could be directly used \nin applications such as fertiliser production or potentially as a shipping fuel (see \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation), avoiding the need for \nreconversion into hydrogen. A preference for ammonia as a near-term trade option \nis also reflected in the 58 national hydrogen strategies published so far, many of \nwhich mention ammonia trade as well as potential demand volumes (see Chapter \n6. Policies). Less than 10% of the volume that could be traded by 2030 based on \nannounced projects is using hydrogen in its pure form, whether liquefied or \ncompressed, while around 2% is in the form of synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. \nSynthetic methane, which is produced from hydrogen and CO2 and is compatible \nwith existing natural gas infrastructure and end uses, accounts for around 0.7% of \nthe announced trade projects in 2030. Announced projects to produce synthetic \nmethane in Australia, the United States and Peru for exports to Japan are at early \ndevelopment stages. \nAustralia and the United States could become the largest exporters by 2030, \ntogether accounting for 10 Mtpa H2-eq by 2030 – more than a third of this volume, \nhowever, is from a single project in Kalgoorlie (Australia) for which the exact export \n0\n 5\n 10\n 15\n 20\n 25\n 30\n2030\n2040\n2030\n2040\nby exporting region\nby importing region\nMt H2-eq\nNot defined\nOthers\nKorea\nJapan\nUnited States\nEurope\nAustralia\nMiddle East\nAfrica\nLatin America\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4.

Latin America could become the \nthird-largest exporter, with more than 2 Mtpa H2-eq by 2030, although a large part \nof this has not yet found a delivery destination. Among the projects that have a \ndefined import destination, Europe accounts for 75% of the announced import \nvolume and is expected to become a key market for hydrogen and hydrogen-\nbased fuels and feedstocks. Countries in the Asia Pacific region represent another \nimportant demand centre: based on announced projects, Japan and Korea \ntogether could import 3.7 Mtpa H2-eq by 2040. \nLooking ahead to potential exports by 2030, only around 0.5 Mtpa H2-eq is from \nprojects that already have an offtake agreement in place with a buyer. All of these \nprojects are for the delivery of ammonia. It is perhaps little surprise that the two \nlargest traders of this commodity today – Trammo and Yara International – have \nboth signed offtake agreements for low-emissions ammonia from projects under \ndevelopment. Each had a purchased volume of about 4 Mtpa of ammonia in 2022 \n(including ammonia from unabated fossil fuels), accounting for just under half of \nall global trade of ammonia, which mainly serves the fertilisers sector. In the case \nof the NEOM project in Saudi Arabia, Air Products is part of the joint venture \nbehind the project, and is also the sole offtaker. In this case, the target market is \ndifferent, as the company aims to export ammonia for its subsequent reconversion \ninto hydrogen for use as fuel in the transport sector. Another use of ammonia can \nbe seen in the case of the Donaldsonville (United States) project by CF Industries: \nJapan’s largest power generation company, JERA, plans to import the purchased \nammonia to meet demand for low-carbon fuels in Japan (Table 4.2). \nTable 4.2 \nSelected export projects with identified offtaker \nProject name \nDeveloper \nOfftaker \nOfftake agreement \nTeal ammonia plant, \n(Quebec, Canada) \nTeal \nTrammo \nAgreement for 800 ktpa of \nammonia supply that Trammo will \ndistribute to global customers from \n2027, for 15 years. \nNEOM Green \nHydrogen Project \n(Saudi Arabia) \nNEOM, ACWA \nPower, Air \nProducts \nAir Products \nAir Products is the sole offtaker of \nthe 1.2 Mtpa ammonia from the \nproject, from 2027, for 30 years. \nCF Industries blue \nammonia \n(Donaldsonville, \nUnited States) \nCF Industries \nJERA \nJoint development agreement \nincluding the supply of 500 ktpa of \nammonia from 2028. \nGreen Hydrogen and \nChemicals SPC \n(Oman) \nACME, Green \nHydrogen and \nChemicals \nCompany  \nYara \nInternational \nAgreement to buy 100 ktpa of \nammonia. \nEgypt Green \nHydrogen Project \nFertiglobe \nHintco \nAgreement for up to 397 kt NH3 \nover the period 2027-2033 (with a \nguaranteed minimum offtake of \n240 kt NH3). \nPhase-1 of green \nammonia project in \nOdisha (India) \nACME \nIHI \nAgreement for over 400 ktpa NH3 \nfrom 2028 \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4.

Five large-scale \nprojects alone account for 8.3 Mtpa, or half of all announced export-oriented \nproduction in 2030 (16 Mtpa). None of these projects has reached FID and one is \nundergoing feasibility studies, while four are at very early development stages. \nDepending on the progress of these large-scale projects, the actual amount of \nlow-emissions hydrogen traded by 2030 could vary significantly. \nTrade contracts and tenders \nThe majority of announced trade projects to date are based on bilateral trade \ncontracts, which can provide investment security to project developers for capital-\nintensive hydrogen production plants and transport infrastructure by offering clear \npricing mechanisms and a sufficient contract duration. Auctions or tenders are \noften used as competitive instruments to award these contracts. In most cases, \nauctions are designed so that suppliers bid for the lowest price for which they are \nwilling to sell a certain amount of hydrogen or hydrogen-based fuel (which may be \nalso specified as part of the bid). \nOver the past year, several international auctions or tenders for low-emissions \nhydrogen have been launched, in many cases initiated by companies planning to \nuse low-emissions hydrogen. In Germany, several steel makers (including \nSalzgitter AG, Stahl-Holding Saar and thyssenkrupp Steel Europe AG) announced \ntenders for low-emissions hydrogen. Outside the steel sector, Total Energies \nannounced in September 2023 a tender for 500 000 tpa H2 of renewable hydrogen \nfor its refineries in Europe (more details on the tenders are available in Chapter 2. \nHydrogen demand). \nAuctions initiated by companies suggest that there is a demand for low-emissions \nhydrogen, which often has been fostered by policy instruments such as incentives \nor grants. One instrument that combines support for low-emissions hydrogen \nsupply with demand creation is a double auction, in which an intermediary “market-\nmaker” buys low-emissions hydrogen through long-term offtake agreements from \nsuppliers and sells the hydrogen to end users, helping to create a market. As such, \nthe auction covers both buying and selling hydrogen, with the intermediary market-\nmaker covering any losses incurred from the difference between purchase cost \nand sale price. The H2Global initiative is based on such a double-auction \nmechanism. The German government was the first supporter of the H2Global \napproach, committing EUR 900 million to H2Global’s pilot auction, implemented \nby Hintco, a 100% owned subsidiary of the H2Global Foundation. Hintco enters \ncontracts with sellers and buyers, who often struggle to connect independently at \nan early stage of market development. This intermediary then buys products – \nwhich are typically more expensive than their carbon-intensive counterparts – to \nsell them through an auction at a lower price to end consumers, thereby supporting \ngrowth in demand.

Fertiglobe, a joint venture of OCI and ADNOC, was awarded the lot for \nammonia at a delivered price to Europe of EUR 1 000/t NH3 (EUR 811/t NH3 net \nprice excluding delivery). Fertiglobe plans to produce the ammonia in Egypt using \nhydrogen from the Egypt Green Hydrogen project, with deliveries to Europe \nstarting in 2027 with a potential 19.5 kt NH3 and rising to a total of 397 kt NH3 \ncumulatively by 2033. The sales auction for renewable ammonia is set to start in \n2025-2026. No winners were awarded for the H2Global tender for synthetic \nkerosene, and the funds will instead be allocated to the tender for synthetic \nmethanol, for which winners have not yet been announced. Moving forward, \nGermany has allocated an additional EUR 3.83 billion to new tenders of the \nH2Global programme, including a joint tender by the Netherlands and Germany \nfor hydrogen imports to Europe, with each country contributing EUR 300 million. \nWhile the first round of H2Global tenders was not dedicated to specific supply \nregions or countries, future auctions could be geographically targeted. Canada \nand Germany announced a joint H2Global auction for hydrogen trade from \nCanada \nto \nGermany, \nwith \neach \ncountry \ncommitting \nCAD 300 million \n(USD 221 million) and the auction to be launched by the end of 2024. Australia \nand Germany announced a similar H2Global tender, with funds of up to \nEUR 400 million (USD 443 million).  \nStatus and outlook of hydrogen \ninfrastructure \nHydrogen transport infrastructure is essential to connect supply and demand \nregions, while storage enables efficient management of fluctuations and enhances \nsystem resilience in the event of supply disruptions. However, the development of \ninfrastructure for hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels faces several challenges: \n \nGas infrastructure projects are large civil engineering projects, often spanning \nseveral jurisdictions. As a result, they tend to have long lead times, due in part to \nlengthy permitting processes and, often, a lack of socio-political support. On \naverage, these projects, including natural gas pipelines, port terminals and \nunderground gas storage facilities, take between 6 and 12 years to complete. \n \nThe capital costs associated with gas transport and storage infrastructure benefit \nsignificantly from economies of scale, particularly in the case of pipelines, which \ncan facilitate the competitively priced transport of large quantities of energy over \nlong distances. For example, a new 20-inch diameter pipeline can transport up to \n1.2 GW of hydrogen at a levelised cost of USD 0.6/kg H2/1 000 km. By \ncomparison, a new 48-inch diameter pipeline can transport up to 17 GW of \nhydrogen at a levelised cost of less than USD 0.2/kg H2/1 000 km. For reference, \na high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line of 500 kV, which is often \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 114  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nused for power transmission over long distances, can transport approximately the \nsame energy as a 20-inch pipeline, though at 2.5 times more cost per GWh for a \n1 000 km distance (Figure 4.4). \nThe long lead times associated with gas and power infrastructure mean that it \nmust be planned ahead of the supply and demand projects it will connect, which \nusually have shorter lead times. Failure to do so may prevent these projects from \nreaching FID. Planning must also incorporate long-term foresight to accurately \nanticipate infrastructure needs and avoid oversizing facilities that may remain \nunder-utilised, even as projects reach economies of scale. \nFigure 4.4 \nIndicative levelised cost of delivering hydrogen, by transport option and \ndistance in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, 2030 \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: HVDC = high-voltage direct current; H2 = hydrogen; ktpa = kilotonnes per year; LH2 = liquefied hydrogen; LOHC = \nliquid organic hydrogen carrier (methylcyclohexane considered); USD/kg H2 = USD per kilogramme of hydrogen. Hydrogen \npipelines refer to onshore transmission pipelines operating at 25-75% of their design capacity for 5 000 full-load hours. \nElectricity transmission by offshore HVDC indicates electricity transmission required to obtain 1 kg H2 in an electrolyser with \n69% efficiency. Transport costs by ship include investment and operational costs to convert hydrogen to a higher-density \ncarrier, store it, ship it and reconvert it to deliver gaseous hydrogen. Shipping capacity range corresponds to the annual \ncapacity of a port terminal with 10 (upper cost range) to 30 (lower cost range) shipments per year. \nPipelines are the most cost-effective transport option, particularly for large volumes, while \nshipping becomes more economical over longer distances. \nTransport by pipeline \nThe total length of natural gas transmission pipelines in operation is currently \napproximately 1 million km. In addition, about 70 000 km are under construction \nand about 160 000 km are under consideration. As natural gas consumption falls \nin the transition to net zero emissions, repurposing this infrastructure for hydrogen \nrepresents an opportunity to minimise the risk of stranded assets, reduce \nkm\nH₂ pipelines and power transmission lines\nH₂ shipping as LH₂, ammonia and LOHC\n 0.5\n 1.0\n 1.5\n 2.0\n 2.5\n 3.0\n 3.5\n 4.0\nUSD/kg H₂\n 0.5\n 1.0\n 1.5\n 2.0\n 2.5\n 3.0\n 3.5\n 4.0\n2 000\n4 000\n6 000\n8 000\nUSD/kg H₂\nkm\nNew 20-inch pipeline \n(50-130 ktpa)\nRepurposed 20-inch pipeline \n(50-130 ktpa)\nNew 48-inch pipeline \nRepurposed 48-inch pipeline \n(630-1 900 ktpa)\nOffshore HVDC (160 ktpa)\nLH₂ tanker\n(100-300 ktpa)\nAmmonia tanker\n(90-275 ktpa)\nLOHC tanker\n(5-25 ktpa)\n2 000\n4 000\n6 000\n8 000\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4.

CC BY 4.0. \ninvestment costs and potentially shorten lead times, while reducing the \nenvironmental impact associated with manufacturing and laying of pipelines. \nApproximately 5 000 km of hydrogen pipelines are already in operation worldwide, \nprimarily in the United States and Europe. These pipelines are privately owned, \nrelatively small, and connect refineries and chemical complexes, operating under \nconstant loads, all onshore. However, future hydrogen pipelines could be \nsignificantly larger, connecting different countries and even continents, including \noffshore routes. These new pipelines should offer system flexibility, with the \ncapacity to withstand pressure swings from cyclic loading, and provide linepack.55 \nA hydrogen transmission system of this kind would be quite distinct from current \nlocal networks, and would more closely resemble the natural gas transmission in \nuse today, but would be more centralised, and largely rely on trunklines. Even \nunder the NZE Scenario, hydrogen consumption would be lower than current \nnatural gas consumption and concentrated around fewer large users, such as \nindustrial facilities. \nLegal and regulatory frameworks for hydrogen pipelines \nPolicy makers are already working on legal and regulatory adjustments needed to \nenable the deployment of dedicated hydrogen infrastructure. In May 2024, the \nEuropean Council adopted the “Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Markets \nDecarbonisation Package” to reform the existing EU regulatory framework for low-\nemissions gases (see Chapter 6. Policies). The package covers transmission, \nstorage and distribution, introducing unbundling56 and a regulated third-party \naccess regime by January 2033. Hydrogen pipelines will be regulated according \nto the European Union’s standard Regulated Asset Base model, allowing \noperators to obtain a guaranteed return on investment, in exchange for allowing \nthird-party access to their infrastructure. \nThe new regulation also initiated the European Network of Network Operators for \nHydrogen (ENNOH), which consists of certified hydrogen transmission network \noperators in EU member states. In June 2024, future EU hydrogen transmission \nnetwork operators agreed on draft rules for the establishment of ENNOH, including \nstatutes, rules of procedure and a list of members. These draft rules will be \nreviewed by the European Commission and the Agency for the Cooperation of \nEnergy Regulators, with ENNOH expected to be established in the second quarter \nof 2025. The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas and \n \n \n55 Linepack refers to the volume of gas stored in a pipeline. The gas can be compressed, increasing the pressure of the \npipeline. Since the pipeline can operate within a safe pressure range, the amount of gas injected into a pipeline may differ \nfrom the amount of gas withdrawn at a specific time, providing short-term operational flexibility to match supply and demand. \n56 Unbundling refers to the separation of activities potentially subject to competition, such as hydrogen production, from those \nwhere competition is not possible or allowed, e.g. transmission and distribution, which is a regulated monopoly in the \nEuropean Union. This would allow the independent transmission system operator model under certain conditions. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 116  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nENNOH will jointly develop a 10-year hydrogen network development plan, to be \npublished in 2026. This will serve as the basis for selecting “Projects of Common \nInterest”, and from 2028 onwards, ENNOH will be solely responsible for the \nnetwork’s development. \nMember states have started to designate their hydrogen network operators to be \npart of ENNOH and participate in planning the European hydrogen network. In \nDecember 2023, Spain appointed Enagás as the provisional operator of the \nhydrogen transmission network. In April 2024, Belgium appointed Fluxys as \nHydrogen Network Operator for the future transmission grid, in accordance with \nthe Belgian Law on the Transmission of Hydrogen by Pipelines of July 2023. In \nJune 2024, the Netherlands appointed Gasunie as the intended network operator \nfor the future North Sea hydrogen network. Outside the European Union, other \ncountries are also taking steps to develop the required regulatory frameworks. In \nApril 2024, Israel granted Natgaz permission to build and operate hydrogen and \nCO2 pipelines. \nIn June 2024, the EU Commission approved a EUR 3 billion German state aid \nscheme to support the development of a hydrogen core network. The aid, in the \nform of a state guarantee from the state-owned development bank KfW, will \nenable transmission system operators (TSOs) to secure favourable loans. \nGermany's hydrogen network is expected to be completed by 2032, with the \npossible extension of some projects until 2037, and will cover 9 700 km, 60% of \nwhich would be repurposed natural gas pipelines, at a cost of around \nEUR 20 billion. The network will be funded by user charges and private sector \ninvestment, with interim government funding to cover initial shortfalls, through top-\nup funding dubbed “WANDA”. Initially, the network fee will be set at a rate lower \nthan would be needed to cover costs, to prevent very high fees from low utilisation \nrates. The Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) will review the fees every 3 years, \nwith the aim of recovering the investment made by 2055. In April 2024, BNetzA \nlaunched a consultation on determination of the WANDA, and this was confirmed \nin June 2024, with the aim of setting uniform tariffs from January 2025 and keeping \nthem as stable as possible until 2055. Furthermore, the government will implement \nan amortisation system, which will guarantee a 6.7% pre-tax return on equity, with \noperators covering 24% of the costs if the ramp-up of the network fails. In May \n2024, Germany passed the Hydrogen Acceleration Act, which, among other \nthings, gives hydrogen infrastructure the status of “overriding public interest” and \nsimplifies approval procedures.  \nIn April 2024, the Danish government agreed to provide financial backing for the \nconstruction of a hydrogen pipeline network, subject to the fulfilment of certain \nconditions. These include securing a committed booking capacity of 1.4 GW \n(approximately 44% of the pipeline’s total capacity), with the possibility of lower \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 117  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \ntariffs being charged by the Danish gas TSO, Energinet, during the start-up period, \nwith the provision to recover the shortfall once more users are connected. \nThe Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office of the US Department of Energy \n(DoE) aims to develop more efficient guidelines for permitting hydrogen pipelines \nand large-scale projects by 2025, with stakeholder engagement, as outlined in its \nMulti-Year Program Plan. This goal is also a near-term milestone in the US \nNational Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap. \nProject announcements for dedicated pipelines \nA number of project announcements and updates on hydrogen transmission \npipelines across and between countries have been made during the past year.57  \nFigure 4.5 \nGlobal hydrogen transmission pipeline length in the Net Zero Emissions \nby 2050 Scenario and announced projects, 2035-2040 \n \nIEA.

In addition, construction of a 700 km \nhydrogen pipeline in China is due to start in mid-2024. \nIn spite of these announcements, uncertainties in production and demand, \ncoupled with a still-limited regulatory framework, could mean that there is not yet \nsufficient financial and legal certainty for potential investors in low-emissions \nhydrogen infrastructure. This is already impacting plans for the development of \ninfrastructure projects. The target year for the completion of Germany's planned \nhydrogen pipeline network is 2032, but in April 2024 an extension of 5 years was \nannounced, pushing the completion date to 2037, so as to facilitate financing and \nallow more time for certain projects to become operational. Similarly, in June 2024, \nthe completion of the Delta Rhine Corridor between the Netherlands and Germany \nwas delayed by 4 years, from 2028 to 2032. Simultaneous construction of \npipelines for hydrogen, CO2 and ammonia has proved challenging due to different \nrequirements, and separate timelines for each pipeline will now be considered.  \nDelays in the deployment of hydrogen infrastructure have a knock-on effect on the \nspeed at which low-emissions hydrogen production and demand can scale up. \nWithout the necessary infrastructure, the link between production and demand \ncannot be made. For the developers of projects to produce low-emissions \nhydrogen, this increases the risk of being unable to secure offtakers, since they \nhave no visibility on when they could be able to deliver their product to consumers. \nSimilarly, a lack of certainty on infrastructure also puts at risk the plans of potential \nconsumers of low-emissions hydrogen (which are often developed as a response \nto new regulatory requirements), since they cannot be sure of securing supply. \nAlthough the deployment of hydrogen pipelines has been sluggish, gas TSOs \nhave issued several calls to confirm interest in hydrogen transmission \ninfrastructure since mid-2023 (Table 4.3). Calls typically start with a non-binding \nphase to assess market needs and conduct feasibility studies. If this initial phase \nis successful, it is followed by a binding phase, in which transmission capacity is \ncontracted and investment decisions are made. In December 2023, the first \ncapacity contract was signed for the transport of low-emissions hydrogen through \na repurposed ONTRAS pipeline. This contract secures transport capacity for \nproducers to deliver hydrogen to the TotalEnergies refinery in Leuna, Germany, \nby 2025. In addition, since the GHR 2023, several non-binding calls of interest \nhave been launched in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. For cross-\nborder hydrogen transmission networks, high-level announcements and \ncommitments from gas TSOs and/or governments in the jurisdictions concerned \nare crucial to enabling the development of networks and related infrastructure.  \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4.

Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 120  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nThe European Hydrogen Backbone initiative involves 33 gas infrastructure \noperators from 25 EU member states, as well as Norway, Switzerland and the \nUnited Kingdom. The latest roadmap for this initiative envisions a 31 000 km pan-\nEuropean hydrogen pipeline network by 2030, based on repurposed natural gas \npipelines wherever possible. There are additional co-ordination activities between \nEuropean gas TSOs to co-operate on the development of joint cross-infrastructure \nhydrogen pipelines. In June 2024, nine European gas TSOs signed a Memorandum \nof Understanding (MoU) to co-ordinate and facilitate hydrogen infrastructure in the \nBaltic Sea region. This is intended to contribute to the Marienborg Declaration of \nAugust 2022, which commits to strengthen energy security in the region by exploring \njoint cross-border renewable energy projects and identifying infrastructure needs. \nSome of the projects resulting from these co-operation initiatives are already \nmoving forward. In April 2024, the European Commission published the first list of \nProjects of Common Interest (PCI) and Projects of Mutual Interest (PMI). Of the \n166 selected projects, 31 relate to the development of onshore and offshore \nhydrogen pipelines, including between member countries (in the framework of \nPCIs), as well as PMIs with non-member countries. These projects will benefit \nfrom streamlined permitting, regulatory support and possible EU financing from \nthe Connecting Europe Facility. The process for establishing the second EU list of \nPCIs and PMIs will start in the third quarter of 2024. \nIn February 2024, the European Commission approved the third round of \nImportant Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) for hydrogen \ninfrastructure under EU state aid rules. A total 33 projects in seven member states \n– France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia – were \napproved, committing up to EUR 6.9 billion in public funding, with the expectation \nof unlocking a further EUR 5.4 billion in private investment. IPCEI Hy2Infra aims \nto deploy approximately 2 700 km of new and repurposed hydrogen transmission \nand distribution pipelines for operation by 2027-2029. \nWhile there are still no offshore hydrogen pipelines, offshore projects are also \nadvancing. In April 2024, Gassco (Norway) and GASCADE (Germany) signed an \nMoU to transport hydrogen by pipeline from Norway to Germany by 2030, a project \nwith PMI status. Gassco would develop the Norwegian export infrastructure, while \nGASCADE would develop “AquaDuctus”, an offshore hydrogen pipeline in the \nNorth Sea to connect to Germany. In June 2024, Enagás (Spain), GRTgaz and \nTeréga (France), in co-operation with OGE (Germany), signed a joint development \nagreement for the BarMar hydrogen infrastructure, which holds PCI status. This \nagreement outlines conditions for feasibility studies, and preliminary conditions for \nan FID, with Enagás contributing 50%, GRTgaz 33.3%, and Teréga 16.7%. In April \n2024, Germany and the United Kingdom announced a joint feasibility study on \nhydrogen trade (including via offshore pipeline), with results expected by the end \nof the year. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 121  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nAnnouncements have also been made outside Europe for both onshore and \noffshore hydrogen pipelines. In September 2023, Morocco announced plans to \nbuild a 5 600 km hydrogen pipeline from Nigeria through 11 West African states, \nmostly offshore, in parallel with a planned natural gas pipeline for which feasibility \nstudies are underway. In the same month, Oman announced plans for a 2 000 km \nhydrogen pipeline network, which may extend to other countries such as the \nUnited Arab Emirates. A few months later, it was reported that Hydrogen Oman \n(Hydrom) was establishing an infrastructure company for the hydrogen sector, \nwith OQGN, the owner and operator of Oman's natural gas transmission network, \nas one of the stakeholders. In October 2023, Singapore’s Sembcorp Utilities and \nIndonesian state-owned utility company PLN signed a joint development study \nagreement to explore the feasibility of an offshore hydrogen pipeline from \nIndonesia to Singapore. In the same month, Singapore’s City Energy announced \nthat they would conduct a feasibility study for the transport of hydrogen by pipeline \nfrom Johor, Malaysia, to the Senoko gas plants in Singapore. However, in April \n2024, the Singaporean government highlighted that despite the ongoing studies, \nthere were no immediate plans to construct hydrogen transmission pipelines in \nthe country. In February 2024, Germany and Algeria set up a hydrogen taskforce \nto assess the potential for production, storage and transport of hydrogen and \nhydrogen-based fuels, including by offshore pipeline as part of the Southern \nHydrogen Corridor, connecting North Africa and Europe. In June 2024, Korea \nannounced a USD 577 million plan for a hydrogen belt along its east coast, with \nthe President emphasising the necessity of constructing a hydrogen pipeline \nnetwork. Namibia and South Africa are also exploring the possibility of a hydrogen \npipeline to connect the two countries. \nTechnical advances in hydrogen pipelines  \nHydrogen pipelines already exist today, but there are several technical issues that \nwill need to be addressed for the hydrogen pipelines of the future, which could \nconnect regions, countries and even continents. \nOnshore hydrogen pipeline standards. The American standard ASME B31.12, \nlaunched in 2008, is currently the only standard providing specific requirements \nfor onshore hydrogen pipelines. However, it is now due to be retired, as it was \noriginally designed for smaller pipelines over relatively short distances, and is \nconsidered impractical and overly conservative for hydrogen transmission \npipelines. Instead, relevant requirements will be integrated into the 2026 edition of \nthe widely used ASME B31.3 (process piping) and ASME B31.8 (gas transmission \nand distribution) standards. This will streamline regulatory compliance for \nhydrogen pipelines, enhancing consistency across hydrogen and gas pipeline \nstandards. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 122  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nOffshore hydrogen pipelines. There is currently no practical experience with \noffshore hydrogen pipelines. Nevertheless, ongoing initiatives, such as the \nDNV H2Pipe joint industry project, are working to develop standards for new and \nrepurposed offshore pipelines for hydrogen transmission, focusing on structural \nintegrity, material challenges and safety. In August 2024, a protocol to assess the \nperformance of metals and welds used in subsea pipelines exposed to hydrogen \ndeveloped by Saipem (an Italian energy and engineering construction company) \nreceived two certifications (Approval in Principle and Technology Qualification) \nfrom RINA (a multinational consultancy specialised in inspection, certification and \nengineering). In addition to these standards, several announced projects have \ncommenced feasibility studies involving offshore hydrogen pipelines. In February \n2024, Wood and Tecnoambiente were contracted to undertake preliminary \nassessments and environmental evaluations of the BarMar pipeline between \nBarcelona and Marseille in the Mediterranean Sea. In April 2024, Mott MacDonald \nwas awarded a contract by Gasunie to assess the feasibility of offshore hydrogen \ntransport infrastructure, with Gasunie also assessing the potential of repurposing \noffshore gas pipelines for hydrogen transport. \nDetecting hydrogen leaks. Regulations must encompass detection, monitoring \nand mitigation strategies for hydrogen leakage, especially in transport and \nstorage. However, due to regulatory gaps, hydrogen leakage detection \ntechnologies are currently limited, and primarily focus on identifying large, \npotentially explosive leaks, lacking the speed and sensitivity needed for smaller \nleaks. Although there is no commercially available high-sensitivity technology \ntoday, several projects have demonstrated the use of advanced sensors with \nparts-per-billion (ppb) sensitivity. In April 2024, the US DoE announced up to \nUSD 20 million in funding for the H2SENSE exploratory topic, an initiative \nmanaged by ARPA-E that aims to develop low-cost, high-accuracy hydrogen \ndetection and quantification technologies. In addition, the NHyRA (pre-Normative \nresearch on Hydrogen Releases Assessment) project, funded by the European \nCommission and the Clean Hydrogen Partnership, was launched in April 2024. \nThe aim is to develop methodologies to measure and quantify hydrogen releases \nthroughout the value chain, and propose solutions to mitigate them. \nNon-metallic composite pipelines. Non-metallic composite pipelines are being \nexplored for their lightweight, ductile, spoolable, and corrosion-resistant properties, \nwhich make them easier to transport and lay. Given that they have higher \ninvestment costs than steel pipelines, these composite pipes may be most suitable \nfor shorter distances. In February 2024, Strohm completed a hydrogen permeation \nassessment using a thermoplastic composite pipe, demonstrating an almost tenfold \nreduction in hydrogen permeation compared to a steel pipeline. In May 2024, \nChina’s first non-metallic hydrogen composite pipeline began operating, and can \ntransport both natural gas and pure hydrogen at 42 bar. For offshore applications, \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 123  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nthe HOPE project is aiming to use a thermoplastic pipeline to transport hydrogen \nashore over a kilometre distance to the port of Ostend, Belgium, by 2026. \nHydrogen blending \nHydrogen blending is seen as an interim solution for the period until more efficient \nuses of hydrogen are available, or as a derisking option for large production \nprojects while demand becomes available and the required infrastructure to \ndeliver hydrogen to end users is deployed. However, blending projects face \nconcerns about their efficiency and how the associated cost can impact final \nindividual consumers, as well as local opposition due to safety fears. In spite of \nthese setbacks, a meaningful number of projects are now under development, \nbacked by supportive policy decisions. For example, in December 2023, the UK \ngovernment announced the decision to support blending of up to 20% hydrogen \nby volume into gas distribution networks in Britain. \nBlends of natural gas and hydrogen are already being used in several town gas \nnetworks in Singapore, Hong Kong and Hawaii, with plans to eventually replace \nfossil-based hydrogen with low-emissions hydrogen. For example, in May 2024, \nHawai’i Gas announced a partnership with Euros Energy America to increase the \nhydrogen content of its gas mix from 15% today to 20% (in volumetric terms), \nusing renewable hydrogen.58 Moreover, in recent years, gas operators have been \nassessing the feasibility of blending hydrogen into their natural gas networks and \nany adaptations required. In March 2024, DNV announced that it is developing \nfeasibility studies for Enbridge (transmission) and Fortis (distribution) to determine \nthe percentage of hydrogen that can be safely transported through their existing \nnatural gas infrastructure in British Columbia (Canada). In April 2024, Stuttgart-\nbased gas distributor Netze announced that its distribution network would be able \nto operate with blends of up to 30% hydrogen, with minor adjustments, following \nthe completion of the Hydrogen Island Öhringen project. In November 2023, the \nSpanish gas association Sedigas and BIP Consulting released the CavendisH2 \nstudy, a theoretical research assessment of the retrofitting requirements for \ndifferent hydrogen blends in the existing gas distribution infrastructure.  \nSince the GHR 2023just a few hydrogen blending projects have entered operation. \nDominion Energy Ohio launched a 5% hydrogen blending pilot in a closed loop \nsystem at its training centre.59 In September 2024, the Green Hysland project \ninjected hydrogen from the 2.5 MW plant into Mallorca's 1,400 km natural gas grid. \nThere are some new announcements that may involve larger-scale hydrogen \nblending at the distribution and/or transmission level in the coming years. In \n \n \n58 If not stated otherwise, hydrogen shares are on a volumetric basis. \n59 A list of hydrogen blending projects and their status can be accessed through the IEA Hydrogen Infrastructure Database \n(October 2024). \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 124  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nJanuary 2024, German gas TSO GASCADE confirmed the grid connection of \nHH2E’s hydrogen production site in Lubmin to the EUGAL gas transmission \npipelines. This connection will enable hydrogen blending once the plant becomes \noperational, by the end of 2025, until the dedicated hydrogen pipeline from the \n\"Flow - making hydrogen happen\" project enters service. In May 2024, the \nPortuguese government launched its ﬁrst tender for renewable hydrogen and \nbiomethane to be blended into the national gas network. The tender sets a price \ncap of EUR 127/MWh H2, with a procurement target of 3.0 ktpa H2, divided \nequally, with half designated for injection into the transmission grid and the other \nhalf into the distribution grid. \nDeblending technology, which enables the separation of hydrogen from natural \ngas being transported in hydrogen networks, is still not widely available at a large-\nscale. In January 2022, Linde inaugurated the world's first full-scale demonstration \nplant in Dormagen, Germany, which uses membrane separation followed by \npressure swing adsorption to produce high-purity hydrogen. In May 2023, \nTowngas in Hong Kong announced the successful extraction of hydrogen from \ntheir town gas stream using pressure swing adsorption technology, achieving a \npurity of 99.99%. Elsewhere, in December 2023, DNV announced its support for \nUK National Gas Transmission (NGT) in the FutureGrid Phase 2 project. This \nproject aims to develop a hydrogen deblending, purification and refuelling facility \nat the Spadeadam test site. \nUnderground hydrogen storage \nThe global underground storage capacity for natural gas is approximately \n490 billion cubic metres (bcm), which represents around 12% of annual gas \ndemand. In Europe, capacity can account for as much as one-third of demand to \naccommodate seasonal spikes in demand for heating. Approximately 80% of this \nstorage is in porous reservoirs, primarily depleted gas fields. In a global shift \ntowards low-emissions hydrogen, storage requirements would need to follow \naccordingly. While demand for hydrogen is expected to be less seasonal than \ndemand for natural gas, it will be essential for countries to determine appropriate \nstorage levels to ensure energy security, particularly for those dependent on \nimports. \nHydrogen storage can also be used to provide seasonal flexibility to electricity \nsystems with high shares of variable renewables or strong seasonal variations in \nelectricity demand. Hydrogen storage facilities can handle multiple cycles per year \nto accommodate such intra-seasonal variations. Where geologically available, salt \ncaverns are a suitable storage option. Despite their higher cost per unit of capacity, \nsalt caverns offer a favourable option for managing variability, and lined hard rock \ncaverns (which can be found in more places), may do the same, although this is \nstill at demonstration phase. Despite being more widely available, porous \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 125  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nreservoirs such as depleted gas fields and saline aquifers have yet to be fully \ntested for their flexibility to ramp up quickly, and to assess any issues related to \nhydrogen losses during storage. As such, while the technology for pure hydrogen \nstorage in porous reservoirs has yet to be fully demonstrated, they could \npotentially play an important future role in improving energy security due to their \nlarger size and lower investment cost per storage capacity. \nNew salt cavern facilities for hydrogen storage have been announced, and several \nhave progressed towards more advanced planning stages. In November 2023, \nVortex started drilling at the site of two salt structures potentially suitable for \nhydrogen storage in Canada. In December 2023, the H2CAST Etzel project \ncompleted the conversion of two large existing salt caverns previously used for \nnatural gas storage into hydrogen storage, with leak tests (using nitrogen) \nsuccessfully completed during the first half of 2024. During the second half of 2024 \nthe facility will run leak tests with hydrogen. In August 2024, Uniper inaugurated a \nhydrogen storage pilot at a salt cavern site in northern Germany. The pilot project \ncan store 3 000 m3 and – if tests are successful – Uniper announced plans to \ninvest up to EUR 500 million to expand the facility to commercial scale (with a \nstorage capacity of 250 GWh of H2), subject to the availability of public support. In \nJanuary 2024, it was announced that China had started the construction of its first \nproject for underground hydrogen storage of hydrogen in caverns, in the \nabandoned mines of the city of Daye, which will be dedicated to research activities. \nIn the European Union, seven underground hydrogen storage projects were \nincluded in the first list of PCI and PMI published in April 2024. In addition, the EU \nIPCEI Hy2Infra covers the development of large-scale hydrogen storage facilities \nwith capacity of at least 370 GWh.  \nNevertheless, despite this progress, as of today there are only three projects for \nunderground hydrogen storage worldwide that have at least reached FID – two of \nthem since the launch of the GHR 2023.60 In addition, some storage system \noperators in the European Union have already launched calls for interest (Table \n4.4). All EU operators will have to carry out these market assessments every 2 \nyears, according to the EU Regulation on the internal market for renewable gas, \nnatural gas and hydrogen adopted by the European Parliament in April 2024. \n \n \n60 A comprehensive list of project announcements related to the construction of new underground hydrogen storage facilities \nor the repurposing of existing natural gas storage facilities for hydrogen can be found in the IEA Hydrogen Infrastructure \nDatabase (October 2024) \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4.

Storage (150 GWh). \nGermany \nFebruary -\nMarch 2024 \nStorengy launched a non-binding call for interest for \nhydrogen storage in salt caverns in and around Lower \nSaxony. \nGermany \nApril 2024 \nIn early 2024, Uniper conducted a non-binding call for interest \nto assess demand for 250-600 GWh of hydrogen storage \ncapacity in salt caverns, starting with the Krummhörn site. \nThe results confirmed a strong interest in capacity by 2029, \nwith notable demand for greater flexibility, i.e. significantly \nhigher injection and withdrawal rates compared to natural \ngas. \nGermany \nApril – May \n2024 \nINES, the association of German operators of gas and \nhydrogen storage systems, has launched a market survey on \nthe future demand for hydrogen storage. \n \nSalt caverns. Salt caverns have been used for hydrogen storage since 1972 in \nTeesside (United Kingdom) and since 1983 on the Gulf Coast of Texas \n(United States), mainly for chemical and petrochemical processes, with a total \ncapacity of 500 GWh. Although the technology is already available, further \nresearch is being carried out to test cyclic loading and unloading and the possibility \nof repurposing salt caverns previously used to store natural gas for hydrogen. In \nMarch 2024, the FrHyGe project, supported by the European Union, was launched \nto demonstrate the feasibility of repurposing natural gas salt caverns for hydrogen \nstorage in France and Germany, with high cycle injection and withdrawals. In June \n2024, 350 kg H2 were injected into the Géométhane salt caverns in Manosque, \nFrance, to study the behaviour of hydrogen and to prepare for full-scale \ndeployment in the GeoH2 (France, 6 000 t H2) and SaltHy (Germany, 5 200 t H2) \nprojects by 2030.  \nLined hard rock caverns. In 2022, the HYBRIT project in Luleå, Sweden, \nlaunched the first 100 m³ pilot plant for hydrogen storage in lined hard rock \ncaverns, with testing continuing through 2024. The results show that the \nintegration of storage can reduce the costs of a constant supply of hydrogen by \n25-40%. In March 2024, the UK NGT secured public funding to assess the \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 127  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \npotential of Gravitricity's lined hard rock cavern technology, known as \nH2FlexiStore, which has a capacity of 100 t H2. This evaluation could pave the \nway for a demonstration project in 2025. \nPorous reservoirs. Depleted gas fields and saline aquifers have not been proven \nfor storage of pure hydrogen. Storage of town gas,61 containing up to 50-60% of \nhydrogen, was commercially deployed at several porous reservoirs from the \n1950s until the 1980s, but there were instances of hydrogen loss due to microbial \nactivities, such as methanation and sulphate reduction, which react with hydrogen \nand reduce its content. The extent to which these issues could arise with pure \nhydrogen storage remains unclear. While research has been carried out to \nunderstand the behaviour of hydrogen stored in porous reservoirs, these studies \nhave been small-scale and often involved hydrogen mixtures rather than pure \nhydrogen. In November 2023, the Underground Sun Storage 2030 project in \nAustria, led by RAG Austria, announced that it had started injecting hydrogen in a \nporous reservoir, and in June 2024 announced that it had started its first \nwithdrawal phase. In March 2024, Uniper's HyStorage project in Germany \npresented preliminary results after injecting a 5% hydrogen blend into a depleted \ngas porous reservoir. Almost 90% of the hydrogen was successfully recovered \nand microbial activities were observed on a small scale. Large-scale projects are \nplanned for the end of the decade. In January 2024, the EUH2STARTS project, \nalso led by RAG Austria and supported by the European Union, was launched to \ndemonstrate large-scale underground hydrogen storage in depleted porous \nnatural gas reservoirs. In June 2024, Centrica Energy Storage awarded a front-\nend engineering design (FEED) contract to Wood to prepare the Rough natural \ngas storage facility in the United Kingdom, a depleted gas field, for future \nrepurposing for hydrogen storage. The FEED is expected to be completed by early \n2025. With regards to hydrogen storage in saline aquifers, Fluxys launched the \nBE-HyStore project in October 2023 to explore the possibilities of hydrogen \nstorage in Loenhout, Belgium, which has a potential storage capacity of \n2.4 TWh H2.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n61 Depending on the processes used to obtain town gas, it is a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and other \nvolatile hydrocarbons.  \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4.

CC BY 4.0. \nNote: NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. \nThe long lead times associated with underground hydrogen storage projects mean that \naccelerated action is urgently required to get on track with the NZE Scenario. \nDespite recent project announcements, the expected underground hydrogen \nstorage capacities – 10 TWh by 2035 and 40 TWh by 2050 – are well below the \nrequirements of the NZE Scenario (Figure 4.6). Due to its low density, hydrogen \nrequires three to five times the volume needed for natural gas to store an \nequivalent amount of energy at the same pressure. In the NZE Scenario, more \nthan 230 TWh (85 bcm under normal conditions, 0.5 bcm at 200 bar) of \nunderground hydrogen storage would be required by 2035, compared to the \ncurrent 4 800 TWh (490 bcm under normal conditions, 2.2 bcm at 200 bar) of \nnatural gas storage. By 2050, the need for hydrogen storage in the NZE Scenario \nmay reach a volume comparable to the extensive natural gas storage \ninfrastructure developed over the last 50 years. The current gap between \nannounced underground storage projects and NZE Scenario needs is significantly \nlarger than for production projects, demand creation or pipelines. For hydrogen to \nplay its role in the transition to a net zero energy system, the scale-up of production \nand use will need to be accompanied by the development of the required \ninfrastructure, including large-scale storage capacities that can help to deal with \nseasonality and potential supply disruptions. Failure to have this critical \ninfrastructure available at the time when large production projects are expected to \nstart operating, or when large industries are aiming to switch to low-emissions \nhydrogen, can jeopardise these projects and, therefore, the required scale-up of \nhydrogen uptake (and its subsequent contribution to climate goals). There is an \nurgent need for government, TSOs and industry to work together to find ways to \nspeed the development of storage projects, which have longer lead times than \nproduction and demand projects. \n 100\n 200\n 300\n 400\n 500\n 300\n 600\n 900\n1 200\n1 500\n2035\n2040\n2045\n2050\nbcm - Normal conditions\nTWh\nNZE\nAnnounced projects\n 10\n 20\n 30\n 40\n 50\n2035\n2050\nTWh\nAnnounced projects\nAquifer\nDepleted gas field\nHard rock cavern\nSalt cavern\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4.

CC BY 4.0. \nInfrastructure for transport by ship \nFor transporting hydrogen over very long distances there are options that can be \nless expensive than pipelines (Figure 4.4). Given the complexities involved in \nachieving significant economies of scale, particularly at the initial stages, and in \ncrossing multiple jurisdictions, shipping hydrogen can be an attractive alternative. \nIf pure hydrogen is required at the destination, it can be shipped as liquefied \nhydrogen or as ammonia – which needs to be cracked back into hydrogen and \nnitrogen – or using a LOHC (which should then be dehydrogenated to supply pure \nhydrogen). If pure hydrogen is not required, hydrogen can be transported more \neasily as ammonia, methanol, synthetic fuels, or even in bulk as products \nmanufactured with low-emissions hydrogen, such as hot briquetted iron (see \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus). \nTransporting hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels requires the use of specialised \nport infrastructure. This includes deep-water facilities for the handling of liquefied \ngases such as hydrogen and ammonia, as well as conversion plants for the \ntransformation of hydrogen into hydrogen carriers at the exporting port. \nAdditionally, reconversion facilities may be necessary at the importing port for the \nprocessing of these carriers back into pure hydrogen. \nInfrastructure at ports \nCurrent energy trade by ship relies on infrastructure designed to store coal, oil and \nliquefied natural gas (LNG) in ports. For natural gas, this infrastructure also \nincludes liquefaction facilities at export terminals and regasification facilities at \nimport terminals. In addition, ammonia and methanol are traded globally, albeit as \nchemical feedstocks. The export infrastructure for natural gas, ammonia and \nmethanol (which are mainly produced by steam reforming of natural gas) is located \nin regions with abundant natural gas resources. In contrast, the import \ninfrastructure for these energy and chemical commodities is more widespread, \nreflecting the larger number of importing countries compared to exporting \ncountries. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 130  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nFigure 4.7 \nExisting and announced port infrastructure projects for hydrogen and \nhydrogen-based fuels trade and bunkering \n \nPort facilities for the trade and bunkering of ammonia and methanol are planned around the \nworld, which will significantly expand current capacity at terminals. \nThe current global anhydrous ammonia62 trade is approximately 20 Mtpa, which \nis equivalent to around 3.5 Mtpa of hydrogen and represents approximately 10% \nof global ammonia production. However, as well as anhydrous ammonia \ntrade,63the majority of ammonia-derived trade is currently in the form of urea (16% \nof global ammonia production) and other nitrogen-based fertilisers, which are \nsolids that can be transported in bulk. In contrast, ammonia is a gas at ambient \nconditions and must be liquefied, in addition to requiring specific safety \nconsiderations.  \nThere are currently 150 terminals and ports capable of handling ammonia (Figure \n4.7), but this infrastructure is relatively limited in comparison to the announced \nprojects for trading 13 Mt of hydrogen as ammonia by 2030, which is equivalent \nto around 70 Mt of ammonia (Figure 4.1). To meet this demand, there is a need \nfor a significant expansion of ammonia trade infrastructure, effectively tripling the \ncurrent capacity within this decade. This could lead to a significant increase in \ndemand for port infrastructure to support ammonia storage in liquefied tanks. \nWhile some of this increased capacity can be integrated into existing plants, either \nby replacing fossil-based ammonia trading or by improving annual plant utilisation \nwith minor adjustments, the majority will require major expansion. This expansion \nmay become even more critical in the post-2030 period in light of additional \n \n \n62 Anhydrous ammonia is a pure form of ammonia containing over 99% ammonia and no water. \n63 Hereafter, the term “ammonia” refers to “anhydrous ammonia”. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4.

In \naddition, countries with good renewable energy resources that have not \ntraditionally been involved in energy or ammonia trade may play an increasingly \nsignificant role. This transition will require not only new ammonia storage tanks, \nbut also the construction of new deep-water ports and berthing facilities to support \nthese emerging routes.  \nMethanol is already stored in more than 120 ports worldwide. Storage of methanol \nand LOHC at ports requires simpler infrastructure than storage of ammonia, as \nthey use liquid bulk storage, and existing oil storage facilities at ports can be \nadapted to store methanol and LOHC. \nThere are over 100 natural gas liquefaction plants worldwide, situated across \nmore than 40 ports. Additionally, there are over 160 LNG regasification plants in \nnearly 150 ports. However, the distinct chemical properties of hydrogen and \nnatural gas present a significant challenge in repurposing existing infrastructure. \nThe liquefaction of natural gas occurs at -162°C, while the liquefaction of hydrogen \nrequires a much colder temperature of -253°C, at which point even air liquefies. \nThis difference in temperature presents a challenge to adapting current facilities \nfor handling pure hydrogen. With the aim of addressing these challenges, many \nannounced regasification projects, especially in Europe, are considering flexible \ndesigns to facilitate the transition into multi-molecule hubs in the future. Such hubs \ncould handle synthetic methane without any technical adaptation, and potentially \nalso ammonia or pure hydrogen with a degree of refurbishment and equipment \nreplacement. For instance, in June 2024, Enagás announced plans to assess the \nfeasibility of converting its Musel LNG regasification terminal into a “multi-\nmolecule” facility. In the same month, construction began on Germany’s first land-\nbased LNG terminal, the Hanseatic Energy Hub. This terminal, due to start \nimporting LNG in 2027, is also designed to be “ammonia-ready”, according to the \nproject developers. However, just as in the case of converting already existing \nterminals, the technical feasibility of converting these newly designed terminals \nalso needs to be demonstrated. Certain elements of the infrastructure available in \nthe terminals (e.g. jetties, berthing facilities) are likely to be easily reusable, but \nthere is other specific equipment (e.g. compressors, heat exchangers) that will \nrequire a certain amount of modification or replacement, and there is no real \nexperience of converting them for handling hydrogen-based fuels.64 \nOn the basis of announced projects, more than 100 new hydrogen and ammonia \nterminals and port infrastructure projects could be realised by the end of the \ndecade.65 More than half of all terminals are ammonia export terminals, with more \n \n \n64 More details on the feasibility of LNG conversion to hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels can be found in the Global \nHydrogen Review 2022 and the Energy Technology Perspectives 2023. \n65 A comprehensive list of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels infrastructure projects in ports can be accessed via the IEA \nHydrogen Infrastructure Database (October 2024). \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4.

Further terminals are planned in Brazil, \nEgypt, Namibia, Mauritania and the United Arab Emirates, among other locations. \nAmmonia import terminals account for more than a quarter of all planned \nterminals. In Europe, a number of ammonia import terminals have been \nannounced in countries including Belgium, Germany and, the Netherlands, and \noutside Europe, in Japan and Korea. It is worth noting that the capacity of the OCI \nRotterdam ammonia terminal is being tripled to 1.2 Mt NH3, with completion \nexpected by the end of 2024, after a 1-year delay. In April 2024, Samsung C&T \nsigned a contract to build an ammonia import terminal for co-firing power \ngeneration at Gangwon-do, Korea, expected to be operational by 2027. \nNevertheless, there has been limited progress beyond announcements since the \nGHR 2023. However, Fluxys has initiated several non-binding calls for interest to \nassess the demand for handling hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels at Belgian \nports (Table 4.5). \nTable 4.5 \nCalls for interest for hydrogen-based fuels import terminals at ports \nbetween Q3 2023 and Q2 2024 \nPort \nDate \nDescription \nZeebrugge, \nBelgium \nNovember 2023 \n- February 2024 \nFluxys launched a non-binding call for interest for its \nexpansion plans for the Zeebrugge terminal.

Facilities are being considered in Wilhelmshaven, Rostock \nand Brunsbüttel (Germany), in the port of Antwerp (Belgium), in the ports of \nLiverpool, Newcastle and Immingham (United Kingdom), in the Port of Dunkirk \n(France) and in the port of Krk (Croatia), as well as three facilities in the port of \nRotterdam (the Netherlands). Based on the capacity of the announced projects, \nammonia cracking in Europe could supply approximately 2 Mt H2 by 2030. \nElsewhere, ammonia cracking plants have been announced for the ports of \nDaesan and Ulsan (Korea), as well as plans for a unit in Singapore. There are \neven plans for the construction of an offshore ammonia cracking terminal in \nGermany. In July 2024, Deutsche ReGas and Höegh LNG entered into a \npreliminary agreement to develop the H2 Import Terminal Lubmin in Germany. \nThe terminal would have an output capacity of 30 ktpa H2 and the cracker is set \nto become operational in 2026.

CC BY 4.0. \nTankers for shipping hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels \nExisting tankers can carry hydrogen-based fuels (e.g. ammonia, methanol) and \nLOHCs. Ammonia, a gas at ambient temperature, requires liquefied gas tankers, \nwhile methanol, synthetic fuels and LOHCs, being liquids, can be shipped in \nchemical (including dedicated methanol tankers) or oil product tankers. \nCurrently, around 40 tankers are exclusively dedicated to the transport of \nammonia, with up to 200 liquefied gas tankers capable of carrying ammonia, such \nas liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tankers, as they have similar liquefaction points \n(-44°C for LPG and -33°C for ammonia). According to shipping analytics firm \nVortexa, between mid-2021 and mid-2023, 114 unique tankers had loaded \nammonia, with a combined capacity of around 3.1 million m3, equivalent to around \n2 Mt of ammonia loading capacity. While the fleet includes several very large gas \ntankers, with a capacity of over 70 000 m3, ammonia is usually shipped by midsize \ntankers (25 000-50 000 m3) due to the typical parcel sizes and the availability of \nport infrastructure. New orders for ammonia tankers have already increased, \nreflecting shipowners’ anticipation of rising demand for ammonia cargoes in the \ncoming years. However, an increase in the number of tankers may be constrained \nby the relative technical complexity of liquefied gas tankers, with only a few \nshipbuilding yards in Korea, Japan and China capable of constructing them. This \nlimited shipbuilding capacity could potentially create bottlenecks in the short term, \nand there have already been reports of a lack of capacity in Korean shipyards. \nNew orders for midsize gas tankers have also been on the rise since 2023, \nboosted by the demand for dual-fuel vessels, the anticipated growth in low-\nemissions ammonia trade, and drought-induced restrictions at the Panama Canal, \nwhich favour the transit of midsize gas tankers. In the first half of 2024, 20 midsize \ngas tankers were ordered, approaching the 2023 total of 26 orders. There has also \nbeen a surge in orders for very large gas tankers, with 21 in 2023, and 26 during \nthe first half of 2024, with most set to be delivered from 2027. These tankers will \ninitially serve the LPG market until the ammonia market matures. However, there \nare some concerns of potential overcapacity in the very large gas tanker segment, \nincluding for LPG/ammonia tankers. \nDecarbonising the shipping of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels remains a \nsignificant challenge, which also affects the carbon intensity of low-emissions \nhydrogen when considering both production and transport-related emissions. \nExisting gas carrier fleets can potentially be adapted for low-emissions marine \nfuels, depending on the space required for new tanks and additional equipment. \nThe decarbonisation of ammonia, chemical and product tankers needs to progress \nin parallel to the growth of low-emissions hydrogen trade. In 2016, the first dual-\nfuel methanol tankers that can run on their methanol cargo were introduced, and \nby early 2023, there were 23 dual-fuel methanol tankers, with more orders on the \nway. In the same year, the first orders for ammonia-fuelled ships were placed at \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 4. Trade and infrastructure \n \n \nPAGE | 134  \nI EA.

In May 2024, Trafigura \nplaced an order with the same dockyard in Korea for four ammonia-fuelled midsize \nLPG/ammonia tankers, with the first expected to be delivered in 2027. In August \n2019, the ammonia-fuelled medium gas carrier being developed by a consortium \nof NYK and Nihon Shipyard received the world’s first “Machinery Room Safety for \nAmmonia” accreditation granted by ClassNK. \nThere are currently no commercially available tankers for shipping liquefied \nhydrogen. The Suiso Frontier, with a capacity of 1 250 m3 (~75 t H2), is to date the \nonly demonstration project and completed a shipment of liquefied hydrogen from \nAustralia to Japan in 2022. Several companies are working on the development \nof liquefied hydrogen tankers, expected to be operational by 2030, with hydrogen \ncargo capacities of up to 160 000 m3 (~9 600 t H2) (Table 4.6). In addition, the use \nof hydrogen to fuel ships could have positive spill-over effects, as these \ntechnologies could be incorporated into liquefied hydrogen tankers, allowing part \nof the cargo to be used as fuel. \nTable 4.6 \nAnnounced designs for liquefied hydrogen tankers expected to be \ncommercial before 2030 \nCompany \nH2 cargo \ncontainment \nCountry \nApproval in \nPrinciple* \nVolume \n(m3) \nKorea Shipbuilding & \nOffshore Engineering,  \nHyundai Mipo Dockyard \nSpherical \nKorea \nKorean Register \nof Shipping \n(KRS) \nDNV \n20 000 \nSamsung Heavy \nIndustries \nType C \nKorea \nABS \n20 000 \nHoulder, Shell, CB&I \nSpherical \nUnited Kingdom \nDNV (H2 \ncontainment) \n20 000 \nC-Job Naval Architects, \nLH2 Europe \nSpherical \nNetherlands \n- \n37 500 \nTotalEnergies, GTT, \nLMG Marin, Bureau \nVeritas \nMembrane \nFrance \nBureau Veritas \n150 000 \nKawasaki Heavy \nIndustries (KHI) \nSpherical \n(technological \ndevelopment \ncompleted) \nJapan \nNippon Kaiji \nKyokai \n(ClassNK) \n160 000 \nSamsung Heavy \nIndustries \nMembrane \nKorea \nLloyd’s Register \n160 000 \nGasLog \nNA \nUnited States \nNA \nNA \n* An Approval in Principle is an independent assessment of conceptual and innovative shipbuilding within an agreed \nframework, confirming that the ship design is feasible and that no significant obstacles exist to prevent the concept from \nbeing realised. \nNote: m3 = cubic metre. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 135  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and \ninnovation \nHighlights \n \nIn 2023, USD 3.5 billion was spent globally by project developers on hydrogen \nsupply projects that are under construction. Around 80% of this was for projects \nbuilding electrolysis facilities and the rest on projects coupling hydrogen \nproduction with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). For \nelectrolysers, this was an increase of over 350% compared with 2022, mostly \nfor the industrial and refining sectors. Spending on infrastructure projects – \npipelines, storage and refuelling – remains at a much lower level. \n \nHalf of the spending on electrolysis projects was in China in 2023 and one-third \nin Europe. China leads on annual investment due to the large numbers and \nsizes of projects, which offset lower unit costs than in other countries. If all \nChinese projects that have achieved a final investment decision (FID) are \ndelivered to plan, spending there would rise 140% in 2024. Spending on CCUS-\nequipped hydrogen projects was highest in North America. \n \nInvestment spending on electrolysis projects could rise by as much as 150% in \n2024, based on recent FIDs. Spending on CCUS-equipped plants will also \nincrease in the coming years. Four projects representing around 1 Mtpa in total \nfor hydrogen production with CO2 capture and storage took FID since last year’s \nreport, including new facilities and retrofits of existing plants. For both production \nroutes, the largest projects are reaching industrial scales and this trend, coupled \nwith recent cost inflation, is driving up investment, despite some project delays. \nHowever, annual investment of USD 50 billion is needed this decade to get on \ntrack with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario). \n \nWhile hydrogen company valuations have struggled recently on public markets, \nhydrogen start-ups successfully increased the total equity funding they raised to \nUSD 3.7 billion in 2023. Project developers for industrial hydrogen uses and \ntechnology developers for hydrogen production dominated this total, but deals \nso far in 2024 show more technology variety. \n \nSeveral innovation milestones have been achieved in the past year, and anion \nexchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis and catalytic decomposition of \nmethane to make hydrogen both moved up to Technology Readiness Level \n(TRL) 7. Promising tests of ammonia combustion in boat engines and power \nplants have also been reported. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 136  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nInvestment in the hydrogen sector \nThis report covers four different types of investment that, when considered \ntogether, provide an overview of the capital being committed to the scale-up of a \ncommercial-scale hydrogen industry and an indication of private sector confidence \nin hydrogen projects and firms. \nThe largest category of investment is spending by project developers on projects \nthat have already taken FID and are under construction. For low-emissions \nhydrogen production, we estimate this to have reached USD 3.5 billion globally in \n2023, around 80% of which was for projects building electrolysis facilities for \nhydrogen production, and the rest for projects coupling hydrogen production with \nCCUS. However, given the different unit costs of these types of investments (partly \nbecause some CCUS projects are retrofits of existing hydrogen plants), these \nrelative shares change when considering the expected annual output of projects \nin construction around the world in 2023, to 55% for hydrogen produced through \nelectrolysis and 45% for facilities with CCUS (see Chapter 3). Recent FIDs for \nlarge CCUS-equipped projects look set to support this balance over coming years. \nHowever, spending on infrastructure projects – pipelines, storage and refuelling – \nremains at a much lower level. \nSpending on hydrogen supply projects under construction was over 350% higher \nin 2023 than 2022, and is expected to grow further in 2024 as work ramps up on \nprojects that took FID in 2023 and since the start of 2024. Many of these projects \nhave electrolysis capacities of over 100 MW and up to 2 GW in one case. \nHowever, as described in Chapter 3. Hydrogen production, concerns about costs \nand regulation continue to delay the time taken for some projects to reach FID. In \naddition, for projects achieving financial close, inflation means that costs are often \nhigher today than when the projects were first proposed, a trend that is inflating \nfuture investment projections without increasing the associated expected \nhydrogen production. The Bad Lauchstädt Energy Park 30 MW project in \nGermany, which took FID in June 2023, has experienced cost increases of 50% \nsince the initial engineering design. Another source of high costs is insurance \nagainst performance risks for this new type of industrial activity without an \nestablished track record. New, dedicated products are emerging to make it easier \nto insure projects in the early stages of market development, but so far they have \nlimited scope and unknown prices. \nSince the Global Hydrogen Review 2023 (GHR 2023), several policy \ndevelopments have raised the prospects of higher investment in hydrogen \nprojects in coming years. Japan passed its Hydrogen Society Promotion Act, \nwhich includes a budget of JPY 3 trillion (USD 20 billion) and provisions for 15-\nyear contract-for-difference production subsidies for domestic and imported \nhydrogen and ammonia. In the European Union, the third (infrastructure projects) \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 137  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nand fourth rounds (mobility projects) of Important Projects of Common European \nInterest saw EUR 8.3 billion (USD 9 billion) in total of national public support \napproved for 46 projects, with total costs of twice this amount. In the United States, \nUSD 7 billion in grants was awarded to seven consortia planning hydrogen “hubs” \nthat have total estimated capital costs of USD 50 billion. The 2024 Australian \nBudget included a hydrogen production tax incentive worth AUD 6.7 billion \n(USD 4.5 billion) which individual projects may claim for up to 10 years, and a \nfurther AUD 2 billion (USD 1.3 billion) for large-scale hydrogen projects via the \nHeadstart programme was also announced. The USD 2.6 billion of OPEX support \nawarded to 11 projects under the United Kingdom’s first Hydrogen Allocation \nRound is intended to facilitate GBP 413 million (USD 525 million) in UK projects \nby 2026. The first auction of the European Hydrogen Bank awarded operational \nsupport worth EUR 720 million (USD 780 million) to seven projects for 10 years. \nThe second round, to be launched in late 2024, is expected to almost triple the \ntotal pot. Germany announced a new tranche of EUR 3.5 billion (USD 3.8 billion) \nfor its H2Global double-auction scheme, and the Dutch government joined the \nH2Global process. France agreed grants of more than EUR 140 million \n(USD 150 million) to two individual projects. These and other policy developments \nare described in more detail in Chapter 6. Policies. \nThe other types of investment covered in this section include commitments of \nmultilateral development banks (MDBs) to provide finance for hydrogen efforts, \nespecially in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). After a flurry \nof announcements in 2023, this type of investment has seen less activity in 2024. \nThe section also includes equity investment in hydrogen-focused companies and \nfunds, including those listed on public exchanges and start-ups raising venture \ncapital. While the value of investments in the former has declined since GHR 2023 \namid uncertainty about major contracts for equipment supplies, the latter rose to \nnearly USD 3.7 billion, signalling that investors continue to see significant long-\nterm market value in high-performing hydrogen technologies. \nSpending on hydrogen supply projects in construction \nThe amount of money flowing to hydrogen projects continues to grow rapidly, \ndemonstrating that new assets – especially for the production of hydrogen – are \ngetting financed on commercial terms. This is despite the various headwinds \nfacing developers, which are described throughout this report. \nElectrolysis \nThe majority of investment in 2023 was in the deployment of hydrogen \nelectrolysers and associated equipment. Investment in electrolysers continued its \ngrowing trend to reach a record high of USD 2.9 billion in 2023, almost five times \nthe level reached in 2022. This trend is expected to continue in 2024, with \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 138  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \ninvestment increasing 150% compared to 2023. Even though the rate of \ndeployment is impressive, it still represents only 6% of the USD 50 billion that \nneeds to be invested on average annually until 2030 in order to get on track with \nthe NZE Scenario. \nSpending is rising in all regions and our 2024 estimate includes spending on close \nto 50 projects, across five continents, that have taken FID since GHR 2023. This \nspending is in addition to the continued investment in 2024 in projects that had \nalready started construction before GHR 2023. Among the projects that have \ntaken FID since GHR 2023, the largest is Greenko ZeroC, an ammonia production \nproject in eastern India that is sited at an existing urea plant and is designed to \nhave 1.3 GW of electrolysers. Following FID in August 2024, its developers aim to \nexport ammonia to Europe from 2026. \nMore spending is occurring in China than any other region, despite the revocation \nof development rights by authorities in Inner Mongolia for several projects in the \nregion (accounting for more than 3 GW of electrolysis capacity).66 Given the lower \ncosts in China, this will result in an even higher share of capacity additions when \nthese projects under construction enter operation. Among the largest projects that \nhave taken FID since GHR 2023 are the Taonan Green Methanol project (with \naround 700 MW of electrolysis), the Tianying Green Methanol project (around \n670 MW of electrolysis) and the Fengzhen, project in China will have over 650 MW \nof proton exchange membrane (PEM) capacity, making it the largest PEM project \nin the world. Also in China, Goldwind, a Chinese wind energy manufacturer, and \nMærsk, a Danish shipping giant, are collaborating on a 550 MW project to make \nhydrogen for methanol production by 2026. China is continuing to build more large \nprojects than any other country, driven by the strategies of state-owned \nenterprises, concessional finance from local government and rules to limit \nrenewable electricity curtailment. If all Chinese projects that have reached FID are \ndelivered according to their development plans, spending there would rise 140% \nin 2024 compared with 2023. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n66 Energy Iceberg (2024), Hydrogen Policy Navigator; Six mega green hydrogen projects were cancelled by Inner Mongolia \nenergy regulator. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5.

Estimates \nare based on capital cost assumptions and announced capacities of electricity input or hydrogen output volumes per \nproject and include electrolysers for hydrogen supply used for energy purposes or as an alternative to fossil fuel use in \nindustry (such as chemical production and oil refining). “Other” includes buildings heating, combined heat and power, grid \ninjection, biofuels upgrading and unspecified uses. \nSource: IEA analysis based on data from McKinsey & Company and the Hydrogen Council, STORE&GO (2019), \ncommunications with companies, BNEF 2024, TNO 2024, the IEA Hydrogen Production Projects Database (October 2024). \nInvestment in electrolysers is on a steep growth trajectory: the record investment of 2022 \nalmost quintupled in 2023, and a further 150% growth is anticipated through 2024. \nIn Europe, investment is expected to rise 140% in 2024 compared to 2023 and to \ncontinue to account for around one-third of global investment in electrolysers. \nAmong the FIDs taken in Europe since GHR 2023, the Boden steel plant being \nbuilt by Stegra – formerly H2 Green Steel – for 2030 in Sweden is the largest in \nterms of electrolysis capacity, at 700 MW of electrolysis capacity. The FID, in April \n2024, was for a total plant cost of over USD 7 billion, making it the world’s largest \nhydrogen-related project in terms of financial scale. In Germany, EWE has taken \nFID on a 320 MW electrolysis plant in Emden and RWE is constructing 300 MW \nof electrolysis at its GET H2 Nukleus project in Lingen, both of which will serve \nindustrial hydrogen consumers. Four projects installing around 100 MW each took \nFIDs to supply hydrogen to the refining, mobility and biofuel upgrading sectors: \nCCU-HUB Aalborg methanol project in Denmark; CRI’s Circlenergy methanol \nproject in Norway; Galp’s Grey2Green project on the site of a decommissioned \ncoal-fired power plant in Portugal67;and a project of Shell in Germany to expand \nthe 10 MW “REFHYNE” electrolyser already operating at its Rheinland refinery. \nTwo other projects larger than 50 MW took FID in Germany (with USD 130 million \nof public grants) and Romania (with USD 50 million of public grants) for industrial \n \n \n67 The project has received USD 30 million in public grants and has applied for IPCEI support from the Portuguese \ngovernment to cover a share of the private costs. \n0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024e\nBillion USD (2023)\nUnited States\nChina\nEurope\nLatin America\nOther\n0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024e\nIndustry or refining\nMobility\nElectricity storage\nH₂-based fuels or trade\nOther\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5.

Each of these projects likely \nsuffered cost inflation since the first estimates were made. \nIn the United States, which accounts for about 12% of global investment in \nelectrolysers today, a 100% increase in electrolyser investment in 2024 is \nforeseen. Two projects have taken FID since GHR 2023, the larger of which \ninvolves building an 80 MW electrolyser facility by 2026 for refuelling trucks. The \nUSD 550 million capital cost is expected to be borne by the promoter, Fortescue, \nand recovered via the 45V tax credit, pending final guidance for 45V. The other \nproject is for 40 MW of electrolysis to produce liquefied hydrogen to be delivered \nby road to customers in the material handling, vehicle refuelling and stationary \npower sectors from the end of 2024. While the direct policy support for the \ninvestment is unclear, the supplier, Plug, benefits from concessional finance and \ngrants for manufacturing from the US government. Overall, US investments since \nGHR 2023 may have been higher if clarification of the rules for implementation of \n45V – including the time-matching requirements for renewable electricity inputs – \nhad not been delayed further, with market players still awaiting the decision on the \nfinal rules, expected later this year. Uncertainty relating to the outcome of the US \nelection in 2024 and its impact on hydrogen support policies is also impeding \ninvestment. \nOutside these major regions, there was notable FID activity in Australia and \nMalaysia. In Parak, Malaysia, a local renewable energy developer is working with \na Chinese power company to construct 60 MW of electrolysis capacity, powered \nby floating solar PV, at a capital cost of around USD 400 million. The intended use \nof the hydrogen from this project remains unclear. In Australia, the 55 MW \nelectrolyser being built by Origin Energy, to be powered by grid electricity, will \nsupply Orica’s ammonia fertiliser production. It is supported by USD 75 million in \ncentral and state-level government grants, and is part of a shortlist for receipt of \nproduction subsidies. Fortescue took FID on both phases of its 50 MW electrolyser \ninstallation project linked to a new electrolyser factory that has received \nUSD 30 million from the state government towards USD 76 million capital costs. \nFossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage \nIn contrast, investment in projects under construction for producing low-emissions \nhydrogen with CCUS stood at only USD 0.7 billion in 2023, though this was more \nthan double the amount in the previous year. However, deployment of such \nprojects appears set to ramp up, with six FIDs since GHR 2023, including for what \nis currently the world’s largest potential project to produce low-emissions \nhydrogen. To date, much of the investment in hydrogen production equipped with \nCCUS has been in North America, including several entirely new hydrogen \nproduction facilities. However, of the six FIDs since GHR 2023, three were in the \nNetherlands and were for retrofitting existing hydrogen production plants. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 141  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nAmong the CCUS projects in construction in the Netherlands, the two largest are \nboth for hydrogen supply to the Botlek/Pernis refinery and other onsite industrial \ncustomers from 2026. Both involve capturing CO2 from the production of roughly \n0.1 Mtpa H2 each from existing hydrogen production plants.68 These two projects \nwill receive a 15-year contract from the Sustainable Energy Production and Climate \nTransition Incentive Scheme (SDE++) under which the government will top up any \ndifference between the cost of hydrogen production with CCUS and without. The \nprojects will pay a pipeline operator to take away the CO2 for offshore geological \nstorage via new infrastructure that is also under construction, having received \naround USD 120 million in Dutch and EU government grants. The third project in \nthe Netherlands to have recently reached FID is slightly smaller, but still very large \nby the standards of the emerging low-emissions hydrogen sector. It is for CO2 \ncapture from the production of hydrogen for ammonia and will capture and store \naround 45% of the CO2 that is not used elsewhere, either onsite in the production \nof fertiliser or by third parties. This captured CO2 – and associated payments – will \nbe passed to the operator of a service for shipping CO2 to Norway for offshore \ngeological storage. Due to the CO2 being stored outside of the country, the plant is \nconsidered ineligible for an SDE++ contract, but part of its USD 200 million costs \nwill be covered with a USD 30 million grant from the Netherlands. \nThe largest FID – in terms of budget and potential to produce low-emissions \nhydrogen – since GHR 2023 was in the United States. To put the scale of the \nEastern Louisiana Hydrogen Complex in context, its projected hydrogen output \nwould be three times larger than the roughly 0.2 Mtpa H2 from the world’s largest \nelectrolyser project currently under construction, the NEOM project in Saudi Arabia, \ndespite having a similar capital cost, at USD 7 billion.69 Its projected output is \nequivalent to roughly all the low-emissions hydrogen produced globally in 2023. \nHowever, despite its high CO2 capture rate of 95%, whether all the hydrogen from \nthe Louisiana project will be low-emissions hydrogen will depend on the associated \nemissions from the fossil fuel lifecycle, notably any upstream methane emissions.70 \nAnother large FID was taken in February 2024 for a natural gas-based ammonia \nfacility in the United Arab Emirates that will enter operation in 2027 without CCUS, \nbefore adding CO2 capture by 2030. The project, which has Japanese contractors, \nhas received concessional finance as an export credit loan of USD 27 million. \n \n \n68 One of the two project promoters, Air Liquide, issued a EUR 500 million (USD 540 million) green bond in May 2024 to help \nfinance these types of projects. \n69 While the capital costs per unit of hydrogen production are lower than for NEOM, the costs of hydrogen production will \ndepend on operational and fuel costs and these are likely to be higher than those of the NEOM project, which does not need \nto procure external energy supplies. \n70 Air Products’ indication that its plan for the plant’s finances include the 45Q CO2 storage tax credit suggest that the upstream \nmethane conditions of the more lucrative 45V hydrogen tax credits might be difficult to meet. Other public support for this \nproject is expected to come from a performance-based grant of up to USD 5 million from the state of Louisiana (including \nworkforce development support) and the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programmes. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 142  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nInvestment decisions for hydrogen production with CCUS have continued in 2024. \nIn June 2024, Shell announced an FID for the Polaris project in Canada, which \nwill capture CO2 from a steam methane reformer, among other sources, for \ngeological storage in the Atlas Carbon Storage Hub from 2028. In addition to the \nPolaris FID, Shell and partner ATCO EnPower announced FID to proceed with the \nAtlas Carbon Storage Hub. \nInfrastructure \nThere was some activity in the area of infrastructure development, which \nnevertheless still has the largest gap to fill – current investment levels are less \nthan 5% of what is needed to get on track with the NZE Scenario projections in \n2030. \nOne notable development is the expected start in mid-2024 of the construction of \nthe world's longest hydrogen pipeline, in China, at a cost of USD 845 million, \nexpected to be completed in 3 years. No other hydrogen pipelines have reached \nFID since GHR 2023, though in June 2024 German gas transmission operator \nBayernets secured a USD 230 million credit facility for the construction of a 40 km \nhydrogen-ready gas pipeline by the end of 2025. In the same month, the European \nCommission approved the German government’s request to make USD 3.2 billion \nin financial guarantees available for the construction of hydrogen pipelines in \nGermany this decade. Fluxys, a Belgian pipeline operator, declared in August \n2024 its intention to spend USD 2.2 billion on hydrogen infrastructure over the next \n10 years, three times more than previously foreseen. For cross-border pipelines, \na first step is typically a co-operation agreement between the countries concerned, \nand, in 2024, such an agreement was signed between Austria, Germany and Italy \nfor the proposed Southern Hydrogen corridor connecting Europe with North Africa, \nwhich is one of five components of the European Hydrogen Backbone initiative. \nOn the storage side, Chevron bought 78% of the USD 1 billion Advanced Clean \nEnergy Storage hydrogen project in Utah, United States, in September 2023 after \ndeclining to do so in 2022, even though the project had already secured offtakers \nand a USD 0.5 billion loan guarantee from the US government. This reversal \nindicates that the project’s economics meet the requirements of an oil major, and \nthat Chevron is now more enthusiastic about gaining a foothold in hydrogen \ndistribution in the region. Elsewhere, repurposed salt caverns are also planned to \nbe used for large-scale hydrogen storage in Lower Saxony, Germany. The Etzel \nproject in the region remains at a pilot stage, which the federal and state \ngovernments have funded with a low double-digit million Euro investment for over \na third of the total project costs. \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 143  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nFor hydrogen refuelling stations, Hydrogen Refuelling Solutions secured \nUSD 3.4 million in bank finance to expand its test facility in France for research \ninto heavy-duty vehicle operations. The financing is counter-guaranteed by \nFrench state-owned banks. \nMultilateral financial commitments are moving into the \nimplementation phase \nAfter a slew of very large announcements in 2023 (USD 4.8 billion), less \nmultilateral finance has been announced so far in 2024 (USD 1.8 billion). The \nlargest announcement is the second tranche of USD 1.5 billion of debt from the \nWorld Bank to India, all for hydrogen. This new large allocation of concessional \ndebt lifts the World Bank to representing over half of all multilateral finance for \nhydrogen since 2022 and India to be the recipient of nearly 60% of the total. \nNotable other examples since GHR 2023 include World Bank funding of \nUSD 135 million to Brazil for hydrogen infrastructure development, which may be \nfurther boosted following a Memorandum of Understanding signed at COP 28 that \nforesees a further USD 1 billion for hydrogen-related projects in Brazil. The World \nBank also granted a USD 150 million loan to Chile in 2023. \nMDBs and development finance institutions have a strategic role to play in \nsupporting EMDEs to become first movers in developing a market for low-\nemissions hydrogen. They can support governments to attract private sector \ninvestment by improving enabling conditions, and accepting or mitigating some of \nthe early risks related to individual projects and the low-emissions hydrogen sector \nmore generally, in addition to non-sector-specific risks impacting EMDEs, such as \ncurrency volatility. Moreover, they can support countries in defining policy \nframeworks that catalyse local socio-economic benefits and support the energy \ntransition in line with national development agendas.  \nThe lower levels of announcements in 2024 can be interpreted as a shift by the \nlarge MDBs from building partnerships and high-level finance agreements with \nrecipient countries to working on the details for how to implement previously \napproved programmes, rather than scouting for new opportunities. Many of the \nrenewable electricity-based hydrogen projects funded by MDBs have long lead \ntimes, significant social and regulatory aspects, and complex engineering \nchallenges to resolve, requiring extensive planning and co-ordination for these \nprojects to achieve their promised impact. The approved large-scale programmes \ncover many of the countries that could reasonably invest large sums in hydrogen \ndeployment in the near-term without extensive capacity building. In contrast, much \nof the new funding that has been announced since GHR 2023 focuses on technical \nassistance to help build capacity in other developing economies that could \nbecome major project hosts in future. In the NZE Scenario, more than \nUSD 365 billion is needed in EMDEs by 2030. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 144  \nI EA.

IEA analysis based on the publicly available information until 9 September 2024.  \nIndia and Brazil have been the recipients of the largest MDB financing agreements since \n2022, with the World Bank and EIB responsible for around 90% of the total.  \nIn 2024, the World Bank approved a USD 1.5 billion loan to India for promoting \nhydrogen from renewable energy, scaling up renewable electricity and enhancing \nfinance for low-carbon energy investments. This follows a similar loan to India for \nthe same amount announced in 2023. A USD 100 million loan is also earmarked \nfor Mauritania for institutional capacity building for low-emissions hydrogen \nprojects and minerals mining, building on previous smaller grants for studies in the \ncountry. In June 2024, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n(EBRD) approved a loan of USD 55 million to Uzbekistan for its first renewable \nhydrogen production project, which is expected to create an example for similar \nprojects in Central Asia. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) announced \nUSD 2 million of technical co-operation with Colombia for the development of \nrenewable hydrogen, among other projects. The private sector financing arm of \nthe IDB (IDB Invest) has proposed a USD 35 million loan to Renewstable \nBarbados Ltd to develop hydrogen storage facilities.  \nBilateral funding agreements are also supporting hydrogen development in \nEMDEs. Recent examples include a EUR 20 million (USD 22 million) grant from \nGermany to Algeria, and cumulatively around USD 3 million of grant from the \nUnited States and United Kingdom, to Namibia, Uzbekistan and South Africa in \nseparate agreements. France has indicated it may loan EUR 350 million \n(USD 380 million) to Morocco, in addition to a EUR 0.8 Million (USD 0.9 million) \ngrant for hydrogen projects agreed in mid-2024.

Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 145  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nFinancial performance of hydrogen firms \nIn aggregate, the commercial health of companies that have staked their future \nsuccess on low-emissions hydrogen is not yet robust. Many of these companies \nare scaling up new businesses and therefore necessarily putting significant capital \nat risk (e.g. in factories or project equity) to be able to take orders for equipment \nsales. However, just as project orders have picked up, as projects begin to reach \nfinancial close, these young companies have been hit by higher costs of capital \nand expectations of further project delays.  \nIn order to track investment trends in hydrogen-related businesses, we have \nassembled a portfolio of 45 publicly traded companies in the sector. While the \nmonthly investor returns and revenues of this portfolio rose over the past 5 years, \nits recent performance is more reflective of the troubled S&P Cleantech index, \nrather than the NASDAQ index that is dominated by hardware-light digital \ntechnology firms. The combined capitalisation of the firms in the portfolio has been \non a steady downward trajectory since 2021, reflecting the difficult balance \nbetween needing to spend on R&D, facilities and projects while revenue is not yet \ncovering costs, and the cost of capital on private markets is rising in competition \nwith other investment options. Continued increases in interest rates have led \ninvestors to withdraw equity from sectors struggling to meet shareholder \nrequirements. By the end of February 2024, the market capitalisation of the \nportfolio had dropped back to its level in May 2020. \nAs a reflection of investor wariness about new, capital-intensive sectors such as \nlow-emissions hydrogen, there have been no major new additions to the portfolio \nsince the initial public offering of thyssenkrupp nucera in 2023. The one listing that \noccurred was via a merger of Apex Group, a project developer, with a listed \ncompany that had previously undergone a de-SPAC in 2011 – a relatively low risk \ntransaction. Some existing portfolio members did raise additional capital, though \nthe total amount was relatively small. Among these, McPhy raised USD 33 million \nto help finance its electrolyser factory. \nMoreover, there are signs that companies are taking measures to try to shore up \nthe most viable parts of their businesses. For example, ITM Power sold its \nrefuelling business in late 2023. Nel is spinning off its refuelling business as \nCavendish Hydrogen from its electrolyser business, in an effort to separate the \nrisks of these two different segments, and McPhy has undertaken something \nsimilar. These trends reflect other corporate measures to scale back expectations \nfor refuelling network expansion and profitability, and also reflect the reduced need \nfor electrolyser manufacturers to play a role in creating the market for smaller-\nscale HRS projects as demand increasingly comes from large-scale industrial \nprojects (see Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand). \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 146  \nI EA.

For example, Lhyfe, a company whose share price has fallen 40% \nin the past year, is proposing a new model of co-development of projects to be \nsold to co-owners once operational. Other companies are looking at new types of \npartnerships that help bring in capital, such as the tie-up between John Cockerill \nand SLB. In contrast, larger multinationals that are not solely focused on hydrogen \nhave more options for raising capital at lower costs. \nThe values of specialist exchange-traded hydrogen funds have been badly hit \nsince GHR 2023, reflecting investors’ scepticism that they will quickly find enough \nprofitable companies and projects to beat market averages. No new funds have \nbeen launched. The Clean H2 Infra Fund, which is not publicly traded, has been \ncautiously spending its EUR 2 billion (USD 2.1 billion) war chest that was raised \nin 2022, and joined investment rounds for Stegra and HysetCo. Its manager is \ncurrently trying to raise a further USD 500 million for investment in hydrogen-\nrelated equipment manufacturing, and has used money raised so far to invest in \nHexagon Purus, a maker of hydrogen storage systems. Similarly, the sixth \ninvestment made by Antin’s USD 1.3 billion NextGen Infrastructure Fund I was in \nGTL Leasing, a US-based hydrogen transport and storage equipment leasing firm. \n 100\n 200\n 300\n 400\n 500\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nArithmetic return (January 2017 = 100)\nIEA global hydrogen portfolio\nNASDAQ composite index\nS&P cleantech\n 20\n 40\n 60\n 80\n 100\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nIEA global hydrogen portfolio (USD billion)\nHydrogen ETFs (USD 10 million)\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 147  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nIn a young sector like hydrogen, where corporate viability is so dependent on \ngovernment policy, the precarious financial position of these high-potential firms – \nwhich could supply the technologies needed to accelerate energy transitions – \nshould be a priority for government attention. There may be a role for national \nbanks, as exemplified by the partnership between the Canadian Infrastructure \nBank and HTEC to accelerate infrastructure development. A fund may be \nlaunched in India, but at the moment it remains just a proposal. \nVenture capital and private equity \nVenture capital (VC) investment has continued to increase, reaching a new high \nof USD 3.7 billion in 2023, but the rate of growth slowed down due to \nmacroeconomic conditions that impacted the amount of capital available for \nventure investments across the global economy. Hydrogen-related VC funding \nheld up better than total energy-related VC funding, which outperformed total VC \nfunding across all sectors in terms of equity raised. However, we estimate that \npersistently high interest rates are likely to depress the 2024 total and result in the \nfirst significant annual dip in hydrogen-related VC for a decade. \nSome of the concerns of investors include the barriers to entry due to sky-high \nvaluations of some of the hydrogen companies (which also make it difficult to see \nviable exit pathways for investors), and the difficulty of derisking an entirely new \nbusiness for scalability, with inherent technological uncertainties and often lacking \nestablished supply chains – all while operating in a climate of limited demand. \nGreater momentum in the investment pipeline for hydrogen project deployment \nwill help clarify expected future returns and valuations of hydrogen-related start-\nups. On the other hand, it will also accelerate the necessary process of winnowing \nthe cohort of competing start-ups as more is learned about the effectiveness and \ncompetitiveness of their technologies and processes. \nEquity investment in start-ups with technologies for hydrogen production \nrepresented more than one-third of the 2023 total. Electric Hydrogen, a US \nelectrolyser company, raised USD 380 million in October 2023 and Amogy, also \nin the United States, raised USD 150 million to develop a technology for \nconverting ammonia to hydrogen fuel.71 Some of the equity for these deals came \nfrom oil and gas companies, which together invested about USD 55 million in start-\nups working on various hydrogen production technologies. Ohmium, another US-\nbased electrolyser maker, raised USD 250 million in growth equity in 2023. Large \nbets on electrolysis technologies continued in early 2024 when Sunfire, a German \nelectrolyser maker, raised USD 230 million of growth equity, complemented by a \n \n \n71 As an example of how VC funding can be combined with other finance sources, Electric Hydrogen received USD 50 million \nof equipment financing in March 2024, USD 65 million in US government grants and tax credits in April 2024, and \nUSD 100 million in corporate credit in May 2024. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 148  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nUSD 110 million loan from the EIB. Another start-up developing an electrolyser, \nAustralia’s Hysata, raised around USD 75 million in May 2024. Natural hydrogen \nalso attracted investors in 2023, with Koloma, a US-based technology developer, \nraising USD 91 million in 2023 and USD 245 million in early 2024. In the area of \nmethane pyrolysis technology, Rotoboost, a Norwegian start-up, raised \nUSD 10 million in June 2024, and Sakowin, a French start-up, raised \nUSD 4 million in February 2024. \nFigure 5.4 Venture capital investment in energy start-ups in hydrogen-related areas, \nper technology domain, 2010-2024 \n \nIEA.CC.BY.4.0 \nNotes: Project development category includes start-ups that do not own intellectual property on technology and raise funds \nfor supply-side project development costs. Other end-uses include steel production, chemicals, waste management and \nheating. 2024e is a full-year estimate for all hydrogen-related VC based on data up to Q1 2024, which does not provide a \nhigh enough confidence level for a breakdown by technology area. \nSource: IEA analysis based on Cleantech Group (2024) and Crunchbase (2024). \nHydrogen-related start-ups continued to attract record levels of venture capital through \n2023, but a slowdown is forecast in 2024 given the challenging macroeconomic climate. \nWhile VC investment in start-ups developing electrolysis technology grew nearly \n50% compared to 2022, investment in other areas related to hydrogen – notably \nmobility and supply project development – shrank. The funding raised by start-ups \ndeveloping hydrogen fuel cells fell 80%. Nevertheless, there were notable \ninvestments, such as the USD 48 million investment by Hyundai into Estonia-\nbased Elcogen, which designs solid oxide fuel cells, and USD 44 million secured \nby hydrogen fuel cell company Tangfeng energy. Deals so far in 2024 include \naround USD 70 million raised by INOCEL, a French start-up developing heavy-\nduty fuel cells. ZeroAvia raised USD 116 million in November 2023 for fuel cell \napplications targeted at the aviation sector, but this positive news has been \ntempered by the bankruptcy in mid-2024 of its competitor Universal Hydrogen after \nit had raised over USD 100 million since 2021 and successfully made an initial \nflight in 2023.

However, this was mostly related to \nmore than USD 1.6 billion growth-stage equity raised by Stegra, which is building \na commercial-scale steel production plant using hydrogen as the major reactant, \nand has raised nearly USD 7 billion in public and private finance so far. \nAmong the VC funding raised since GHR 2023 by start-ups working on hydrogen \ninfrastructure technologies, Sinoscience Fullcryo raised USD 111 million, in part \nfor gaseous hydrogen storage solutions. Yara invested USD 2.85 million in Azane, \nan ammonia storage technology developer, and Chevron invested in the ammonia \nproduction company Ammobia. Some more mature start-ups have recently raised \ndebt financing, including HTEC’s USD 250 million loan from the Canada \nInfrastructure Bank for building hydrogen refuelling stations. \nIn terms of the sources of VC finance for hydrogen-related start-ups, we estimate \nthat 88% has come from investors in advanced economies and China since 2019. \nThe role of investors from other EMDEs remains small, though efforts to boost this \nare ongoing in some places. In mid-2023, a new accelerator for Indian hydrogen \nstart-ups was launched by a private consortium. \nMost money has come from funds, such as VC funds, that are primarly seeking \nthe largest financial return, as is the case for energy-related start-ups as a whole. \nHowever, in some technology areas, the share of capital from strategic corporate \ninvestors – that are also buying access to technology and knowledge – is higher \nthan the energy-related average. These areas include hydrogen for automotive \napplications, non-electrolysis production of hydrogen (including from fossil fuels \nand biomass) and hydrogen-based synthetic fuels. Investments from automotive \nand oil and gas firms are all playing a major role in these areas. In other segments, \nsuch as fuel cell and project development, equity investments by the public sector \nare more important than for the energy-related cohort on average. Although direct \npublic investment in equity tends to play a smaller role in hydrogen VC, it can act \nas a strategic investor and help attract private co-investment. Although not for a \nstart-up, this role appears to have motivated the governments of Belgium and its \nprovince Wallonia to have taken a stake in an electrolyser company when it raised \nits capitalisation by almost USD 250 million in mid-2024, with most of the money \ncoming from SLB, an energy technology and services company with extensive oil \nand gas experience. \n \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5.

Low-\nemissions hydrogen production technologies are already commercially available \nbut not yet mature, and demand-side innovation is making slow progress, though \nseveral technologies may be on the cusp of significant advances in technological \nmaturity. \nInnovation in hydrogen production technologies \nElectrolytic hydrogen production technologies are commercially available, but \nother production technologies for low-emissions hydrogen still need to be proven \nat scale. In addition, to ensure market uptake, further innovation is needed to \nreduce production costs by improving efficiency and reducing equipment costs, \nfor example by reducing reliance on critical materials, increasing the stack lifetime, \nimproving the manufacturing process, and designing for recycling. \nHydrogen from electrolysis \nStack innovation \nAlkaline and PEM electrolysers are the most mature electrolysis designs and are \ncommercially available, with ongoing innovation efforts aimed at reducing \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\nElectrolysis\nFuel cells\nProject development\nH₂-based fuels\nNon-electrolysis H₂ production\nAutomotive\nOther mobility\nOther\nAll energy-related\nCorporate Venture\nPublic Sector\nOthers\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5.

Research on PEM electrolysers focuses on minimising \nthe use of expensive platinum group metal components in catalysts to lower stack \ncosts. In September 2023, H2U Technologies achieved a 25 000-hours durability \ntest with an iridium-free catalyst, outperforming other iridium-free catalysts, which \nlast up to 1 400 hours. In February 2024, Toshiba partnered with Bekaert to \ncommercialise Toshiba’s technology that reduces iridium use by 90%. Solid oxide \nelectrolysers (SOECs) achieve the highest efficiencies among electrolyser \ndesigns, although they need to use an external heat source for steam generation, \nand also face durability challenges, with a typical lifetime of around 2 years. A few \nprojects are currently operating at single-digit MW commercial scales, and \ninnovation is underway, such as at Dynelectro, which is seeking to extend their \nlifetime to up to 10 years. Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) electrolysers are still \nat an earlier stage of development, but between 2023 and 2024 Enapter supplied \nthem to several projects around the world, including some projects with a capacity \nof over 1 MW, with one project already in operation in Germany and two more \nunder construction in the UK and the Netherlands respectively. \nHigh-pressure electrolysis \nInnovation efforts to reduce the balance-of-plant costs include increasing \nhydrogen outlet pressure to minimise the need for compression and associated \npower requirements, which are costly, as hydrogen users often require high \npressure. The European Union-funded HYPRAEL project, which began in 2023, \naims to produce hydrogen from alkaline electrolysers at 80-100 bar, significantly \nhigher than current pressurised alkaline electrolysers, with pressures up to 30 bar. \nIn November 2023, Supercritical Solutions demonstrated its 50 kW high-pressure \nelectrolyser at a whisky distillery, producing hydrogen at 220 bar, thereby avoiding \ndownstream hydrogen compressors. Supercritical Solutions and HAMR Energy \nhave since announced plans to further test this technology for methanol synthesis, \nwhich needs hydrogen at high pressure. \nOffshore hydrogen production \nBetween May and November 2023, Lhyfe's Sealhyfe project successfully tested \nfor the first time a 1 MW electrolyser on an offshore platform off the French coast, \ndespite extreme weather conditions. The second stage is the European Union-\nbacked HOPE project, in which a consortium of companies led by Lhyfe aims to \noperate a 10 MW offshore hydrogen production plant off the coast of Belgium by \n2026. The PosHYdon project in the Dutch part of the North Sea plans to produce \nhydrogen on a gas platform, and while onshore testing began in May 2024, the \n1 MW electrolyser is expected to be transferred offshore by year end, and for the \nfirst time, hydrogen will be transported alongside gas via an existing pipeline. In \nDecember 2023, the Dutch government launched an interest survey for two \noffshore hydrogen demonstration projects, and in June 2024, the Minister for \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 152  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nClimate and Energy Policy announced that a first 30-50 MW demonstration project \nwith a budget of EUR 380 million (~USD 410 million) would be selected in the first \nhalf of 2025, to be operational by the end of the decade.  \nHydrogen from fossil fuels with CCUS \nMethane reforming \nIn steam methane reforming (SMR), 60% of the CO2 emissions are emitted during \nhydrogen production in the reformer, and 40% from natural gas combustion in the \nfurnace. Currently, CO2 is captured from the concentrated reformer syngas, but \ncapturing the remaining 40% from diluted furnace flue gas remains costly. \nHowever, hydrogen production from natural gas with CCUS requires capture rates \nwell above the current 60% achieved in commercial operating plants for the \nhydrogen to be classed as low-emissions. To address this challenge, two plants \ncurrently under construction in Canada and United States to become operational \nin 2025 will use natural gas and CCUS with autothermal reformers (ATR) instead \nof SMR, which make it easier to achieve high CO2 capture rates by producing a \nsingle stream of concentrated CO2. Electrified SMR, where the reformer is heated \nby an electric current, eliminates the need for costly capture of flue gas emissions. \nIn October 2023, Topsoe and Aramco announced a collaboration to build an \nelectrified SMR demonstration plant in Saudi Arabia using Topsoe’s technology. \nIn June 2024, Nu:ionic and XRG Technologies announced the first commercial \ndeployment of their electrified SMR, with a capacity of 20 t H2/day. \nMethane pyrolysis \nMethane pyrolysis produces solid carbon and hydrogen without gaseous CO2 \nemissions, thus avoiding the need for CO2 capture. In January 2024, Hazer \nannounced the first production of hydrogen and graphite at its commercial \ndemonstration plant in Australia, using thermo-catalytic pyrolysis, and with a \ncapacity of 100 tpa of hydrogen. In the same month, Hycamite began the \nconstruction of a thermo-catalytic methane pyrolysis demonstration plant in \nFinland, with a capacity of 2 000 tpa H2, which opened in September 2024. \nEmerging technologies for hydrogen production \nOther technologies for low-emissions hydrogen production, such as \nphotocatalytic water splitting, are still at low maturity levels, but some pilot \nprojects are underway. For example, in June 2024, the HyPEC project, a \ncollaboration between Qatar Shell Research and Technology Centre and \nacademia, announced the production of hydrogen from wastewater and sunlight \nin a pilot facility in Qatar. In Spain, the Hylios project will develop new titanium-\nbased metal-organic frameworks for photocatalytic wastewater splitting, while \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 153  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nSparc Hydrogen (Australia) has started front-end engineering and design for \nwhat could be a first-of-a-kind pilot plant for this technology. \nProduction of synthetic hydrocarbons \nDespite the lack of large-scale industrial plants for the production of synthetic \nhydrocarbon fuels, several demonstration plants are seeking to advance relevant \ntechnologies. In January 2024, LanzaJet inaugurated its Freedom Pines Fuels \nplant in Georgia, United States, the largest plant using alcohol-to-jet technology to \ndate. It aims to produce 34 million litres of jet fuel and 4 million litres of diesel \nannually from ethanol and hydrogen, which will be produced using a PEM \nelectrolyser. In March 2024, Infinium's Pathfinder plant in Texas began producing \ne-diesel from CO2 and hydrogen. Similarly, in May 2024, Turn2X inaugurated a \nsynthetic methane plant in Extremadura, Spain, using a 2 MW electrolyser, with \nthe aim of scaling up the technology in other plants. \nInnovation in hydrogen end-uses \nOn the demand side, certain technologies using hydrogen and hydrogen-based \nfuels in applications where there are few alternatives for decarbonisation have yet \nto be demonstrated at scale. However, ongoing innovation efforts may soon lead \nto advances in the technological maturity of key end-use technologies. \nIndustry \nIron and steel  \nIn November 2023, Stegra started construction of the world’s first large-scale \n100% H2-based direct reduced iron (DRI) plant in Boden (Sweden), to produce \naround 2.5 Mtpa of steel. At the same time, construction started on the Oshivela \nproject site in Namibia, which aims to produce 15 kilotonnes per year (ktpa) of \nsteel using 100% H2-based DRI technology from HyIron, using an airtight rotary \nfurnace instead of a shaft furnace, which can reduce iron ore powders and result \nin a more homogeneous product. \nHydrogen-based DRI typically requires high-grade iron ore pellets, which have \nlimited availability. There are several ongoing projects with different technologies \nto use lower-grade iron ore. In August 2024, Fortescue started the construction of \nits USD 50 million Green Metal project in the Pilbara region of Australia, which will \nuse an electric smelting furnace that directly melts and reduces iron ore. This \ntechnology can process a range of iron ore grades and impurities, increasing its \nversatility. The project is expected to start production in 2025 with a capacity of \n1.5 ktpa of pig iron. In February 2024, Rio Tinto and BHP iron ore producers \npartnered with Australian steelmaker BlueScope for the development of an electric \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 154  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nsmelting furnace pilot plant in the country, which could be commissioned by 2027. \nIn Korea, POSCO aims to have a demonstration plant for fluidised bed reactor \ntechnology by 2026, using hydrogen as a reducing agent for fine ore instead of \niron ore pellets, as in DR shaft furnaces. This will be integrated with an electric \nsmelting furnace that can use DRI from low-grade iron ore. In Japan, Nippon \nSteel’s R&D programme aims to test hydrogen-based technology for directly \nreducing low-grade iron ore, jointly developed by Tenova and Danieli, with a \ndemonstration project planned in Hasaki. \nNippon Steel conducted tests to blend hydrogen in a blast furnace in Q3-4 2023, \nand achieved a reduction in CO2 emissions of up to 33%. Nippon Steel plans to \ncontinue demonstration work and implement its Super COURSE50 technology to \nachieve up to 50% reduction of CO2 emissions in large-scale blast furnaces. \nChemicals \nCommercially available designs for the production of ammonia via the Haber-\nBosch process require high temperatures, pressure, and continuous operation \nwith limited flexibility (variable load of 70-110% of nominal capacity). Skovgaard \nEnergy is building a demonstration plant in Lemvig, Denmark that was inaugurated \nin August 2024 using Topsoe's flexible ammonia synthesis technology with a \n5 ktpa ammonia capacity, able to operate from 5-100%. By 2025, Topsoe's \ntechnology will be scaled up at the Baotou plant in China, with a planned capacity \nof 390 ktpa.  \nIn November 2023, the Leuna100 plant in Germany was inaugurated. This is the \nworld’s first pilot plant to produce methanol from CO2 and hydrogen via co-\nelectrolysis, using a novel catalytic process which allows load-flexible operation.  \nHigh-temperature heating \nProjects that aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using hydrogen for process \nheating in different industries are also increasing. In September 2023, in Hofors \n(Sweden), Ovako inaugurated a plant for heating steel with hydrogen before \nrolling, equipped with a 20 MW electrolyser. In June 2023, Hydro announced that \nit had tested aluminium smelting fired by hydrogen at its recycling plant in Navarra \n(Spain), followed by confirmation in November 2023 that the aluminium meets the \nrequirements to be used by Irizar for electric vehicles. In December 2023, \nVeidekke’s asphalt plant in Kristiansund (Norway) produced 3 000 tonnes of \nasphalt using hydrogen as its sole energy source. In April 2024, Schott announced \nthe successful production of optical glass using 100% hydrogen for the first time \nat its plant in Mainz (Germany), with ongoing quality assessment tests. In February \n2024, Holcim announced that it had achieved a hydrogen injection rate of more \nthan 50% in the La Malle cement kiln in France, becoming the first to achieve this \nlevel of blending. In July 2023, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation \nPAGE | 155  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nannounced funding for the Rio Tinto and Sumitomo Corporation Yarwun Hydrogen \nCalcination Pilot Demonstration Program, which aims to be the first to use \nhydrogen calcination in alumina refining. Construction is expected to start in 2024, \nto include a 2.5 MW electrolyser and the retrofitting of a calciner with a hydrogen \nburner. R&D is also revealing future needs for innovation: In November 2023, \nAurubis reported on its tests on ammonia co-firing with natural gas for processing \ncopper into wire rod, revealing that while technically possible, it proved infeasible \ndue to high nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and a reduction in the quality of the \nfinal product. \nTransport \nMethanol-fuelled shipping  \nThe operation of ships with methanol as a fuel has already been demonstrated \nwith commercial vessels and methanol-capable ships already in operation, \nalthough they mostly run on traditional shipping fossil fuels today. In January 2024, \nthe world's largest methanol-powered vessel, the “Ane Mærsk” containership, \ncapable of carrying 16 592 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units), made its maiden \ncall at Tanger Med Port, Morocco, and two similar vessels, the “Astrid Mærsk” and \nthe “Antonia Mærsk”, have since set sail. The Ane Mærsk is nearly eight times \nlarger than its predecessor, the feeder vessel “Laura Mærsk”, which was deployed \nin September 2023. In April 2024, Wärtsilä secured China's largest methanol new-\nbuild order for twelve 24 000 TEU containerships, which are expected to be \ndelivered to two shipping lines by 2026. \nAmmonia-fuelled shipping \nAmmonia-fuelled vessels are not yet at the commercial stage, but progress has \nbeen made on tests of ammonia-fuelled engines for maritime applications, and \nthere are plans for ammonia-fuelled ships to enter service in the next 2 years.  \nWärtsilä announced the commercial availability of the first four-stroke ammonia-\nfuelled marine engine72 for smaller vessels in November 2023, and has already \nsigned a contract with Norwegian shipowner Eidesvik to retrofit an already \noperating vessel. The retrofit is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026, \nmeaning the vessel could become the world’s first ammonia-fuelled in-service \nship. Wärtsilä also has plans to install this type of engine in short-sea vessels73 \n \n \n72 Four-stroke marine engines, which are more compact but heavier, are commonly used in smaller vessels, while the larger \ntwo-stroke engines are typically used in bigger vessels. \n73 Short-sea vessels are ships used for the maritime transport of goods over relatively short distances, typically within the \nsame continent and not involving the crossing of an ocean. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5.

In April 2024, MAN announced a pilot project to install \nammonia-fuelled engines in bulk carriers being built by Nihon Shipyard, in \ncollaboration with several Japanese companies, with the aim of commercialisation \nby 2027. Furthermore, WinGD's 72-bore ammonia engines, the largest for \nammonia and with combustion tests expected in 2024 in cooperation with \nAlfa Laval, have been ordered by CMB.TECH for bulk carriers, with first delivery \nby 2025, and for container ships (by 2026), and by AET for dual-fuel Aframax oil \ntankers.  \nHydrogen-fuelled shipping \nThe use of hydrogen fuel cells for maritime applications has already been \ndemonstrated and the orderbook is growing (see Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand), \nbut the use of hydrogen engines in shipping is still at the earlier stages of research. \nIn March 2024, Mitsui announced the world’s first test of a two-stroke marine \nengine from MAN running on hydrogen at up to 100% load.  \nHydrogen in aviation  \nThe direct use of hydrogen in aviation is still in the early stages of development \nand requires significant innovation and demonstration efforts before it can reach \ncommercial operation. ZeroAvia continues to test its 600 kW fuel cell propulsion \nsystem, which was first flight-tested in 2023, with the aim of carrying up to \n19 passengers on commercial flights by 2025. It is also developing a 2-5 MW \nsystem for aircraft with up to 80 seats, expected by 2027. In September 2023, \nH2FLY completed the first piloted flight using liquefied hydrogen in a small \ndemonstrator aircraft, doubling the range of gaseous hydrogen. At the end of \n2023, Airbus ground-tested a 1.2 MW fuel cell system, with in-flight tests on an \nA380 aircraft (with a maximum certified capacity for 853 seats) planned for 2026, \nand in November 2023, Airbus tested a small hydrogen engine in a glider, flying \nfor 30 minutes, to study hydrogen contrails.

This followed initial tests in 2022 with blends of \n30% of hydrogen that were gradually increased up to 100%, in a first for the \ngeneration of electricity integrated with renewable generation of hydrogen. \nPrevious work from NEDO, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Obayashi in Japan \nhad already demonstrated the use of 100% hydrogen at smaller scale, using a dry \nlow NOx combustion method that improves electrical efficiency while lowering \nNOx emissions. In June 2024 Wärtsilä launched a hydrogen-ready engine (which \ncan be converted to run on 100% hydrogen) and a fuel-flexible engine that can \nrun on hydrogen or natural gas, both of which will be commercially available from \n2025.  \nAmmonia-fuelled technologies \nIn April 2024 JERA started a 3-month pre-commercial large-scale demonstration \ntrial to co-fire 20% of ammonia at its 1-GW Hekinan coal power plant. The results \nof the test were positive, indicating that NOx levels were no higher than from the \ncombustion of coal alone, levels of sulphur oxides were 20% lower, nitrous oxide \nemissions were below the detection threshold, and operability was comparable to \ncoal-fired operation. Based on these results, and provided that the supply of \nammonia can be secured, JERA plans to move to commercial operation from \n2027. While efforts in developing this technology have mainly been spearheaded \nby Japanese and Korean companies, in November 2023 Adani Power announced \nits intention to test 20% ammonia co-firing in a 330 MW coal-fired power plant in \nIndia. \nThe IEA's Clean Energy Technology Guide and Project Demonstration Database \nprovide further information on hydrogen-related innovation projects. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \n \n \nChapter 5.

Most of \nthe growth came from the patenting of technologies in categories that are primarily \nmotivated by climate change concerns, such as those that facilitate low-emissions \nhydrogen production, new approaches to hydrogen storage and avoidance of fossil \nfuels in end-use applications. The data suggest that confidence in future policy-led \nmarket opportunities for low-emissions hydrogen technologies, as well as additional \npublic funding for R&D, are stimulating more new ideas and product designs with \ncommercial potential. The year-on-year uptick is too short to extrapolate into the \nfuture and it is important to note that patenting is typically a lagging indicator of \ninnovation direction and funding. Despite these caveats, the data nonetheless appear \nto offer positive news for clean energy innovation and could translate into lower costs \nand improved technology performance in the coming years. \nFigure 5.8 Hydrogen technology patenting trends by main areas of focus, 2002-2022 \n \nIEA.CC.BY.4.0 \nNotes IPFs = international patent families.

EU hydrogen patent applications rose by \n55% in 2022, taking the region to a level of activity equal to one-quarter of the global \ntotal. There were also notable increases in the United States (34% year-on-year \ngrowth), Korea (40% growth) and China (18% growth). The US trend represents a \nsignificant uptick compared with relative stagnation over the prior two decades. \nAcross the different steps in the hydrogen value chain, patenting is not uniform. For \nthose technologies categorised as being motivated by climate, activity is led by \nproduction and end-use technologies. Although the production of ammonia and \nmethanol from hydrogen are categorised as established technology areas, they have \nlow-emissions applications, and patenting in these areas grew significantly in 2022 – \nby 23% compared with the year before. \nFigure 5.9 Hydrogen technology patenting trends by main regions, 2002-2022 \n \nIEA.CC.BY.4.0 \nNotes IPFs = international patent families.

IPFs for alkaline electrolysis \nhave increased but remain lower than for PEM or SOEC, reflecting the greater \nmaturity of the technology. IPFs for AEM electrolysis have shown steady growth and \nwere responsible for 28% of all the growth in water electrolysis patents in 2022 across \nthese four technology types. Patenting in hydrogen production from unabated fossil \nfuels peaked in 2009 but has continued to grow somewhat in recent years. This is \nalso likely to be partly related to the growing interest in hydrogen for clean energy \npurposes, as some of the technologies that can improve traditional hydrogen \nproduction methods may also have crossover potential, for example for producing \nhydrogen from fossil fuels with CCUS or from biomass. \n0\n 200\n 400\n 600\n 800\n1 000\n2002\n2007\n2012\n2017\n2022\nIPFs\nEuropean Union\nJapan\nUnited States\nKorea\nChina\nBy region\n0\n 200\n 400\n 600\n 800\n1 000\n2002\n2007\n2012\n2017\n2022\nEnd-use\nStorage, transport, transformation\nProduction\nBy value chain step (climate-motivated only)\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 5.

Patents for hydrogen use in the automotive sector continue to grow, \nand represented almost two-fifths of the patenting activity related to end-uses, \nincluding conversion of hydrogen to hydrogen-based fuels and other energy carriers. \nThis share has declined in recent years, from a high of 55% in 2019. Growth in \npatenting related to ammonia – both the production and cracking of ammonia – was \nespecially strong in 2022. However, in general, patenting of inventions that relate to \nhydrogen conversion remains at a lower level than that for direct end-uses. \nFigure 5.11 Hydrogen end-use technology patenting trends by type, 2002-2022 \n \nIEA.CC.BY.4.0 \nNotes: HCs = hydrocarbons.

Policies \nHighlights \n \nPolicy support is now taking strides towards implementation, with almost \nUSD 100 billion of public funds being announced, entering into force, or being \nallocated to projects in the past year. Nearly two thirds of these funds are at the \nannouncement stage and thus are still uncertain, and 95% come from advanced \neconomies, which typically have longer-standing hydrogen strategies. Funding \nfor the supply side is 1.5 times higher than for the demand side. \n \nNineteen new hydrogen strategies were published in the past 12 months, \nbringing the total to 60, and now covering countries that account for over 84% \nof global energy-related CO2 emissions. Most of the new strategies were from \nemerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), and most new targets \nare for production. This represents just the beginning of the policy-making \nprocess – so far none of the new targets are binding or tied to specific policies. \n \nFunding related to demand-side policies from the past 12 months adds up to \nUSD 40 billion. About 20% of these funds target existing applications, while \nmore than half – 60% – is for new applications. Policies already in place could \ntrigger demand for 6 Mtpa of hydrogen by 2030, which would be equivalent to \nonly half of the amount envisaged by announced demand targets, as little as 15-\n20% of production targets, and less than 10% of what is needed in the Net Zero \nEmissions by 2050 Scenario. Around two thirds of the funding are from Germany \nalone, through support for industrial decarbonisation and power. \n \nPublic subsidies were the most common policy instrument in developed \nmarkets, while tax incentives are common across EMDEs. Competitive bidding \nwas used in a diverse range of countries, with auctions carried out in Egypt, \nEurope, India and Oman in order to facilitate market formation, price discovery, \nand competition. Nine countries introduced incentives for electrolyser and fuel \ncell manufacturing, but only six of them have policies already in force. \n \nAt COP 28, 37 governments committed to pursue mutual recognition of national \ncertification schemes based on common design principles. Towards the same \naim, 14 Latin American countries launched “CertHiLAC”, backed by Multilateral \nDevelopment Banks. In December 2023, the International Organization for \nStandardization (ISO) published a Technical Specification that provides the \nbasis for a full ISO standard for the methodology for determining the GHG \nemissions associated with hydrogen production, conditioning and transport. \nThis is expected to be published in 2025/2026. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 164  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nOverview \nThe number of countries with a hydrogen strategy in place continues to increase: 19 \ngovernments have published a new strategy in the past 12 months, principally in \nemerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). Coverage increased \nprincipally in European (7 new strategies), African (4 new strategies), and Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries (3 new strategies). Common drivers \nwere decarbonisation, energy security, domestic industrial development and export \npotential. All the new strategies depict a future characterised by strong exports that \nenable the creation of a burgeoning domestic industry, while there is no new strategy \nthat envisages importing hydrogen. This also reflects the broader trend across \nstrategies published to date. Countries accounting for 84% of global energy-related \nCO2 emissions have now published a hydrogen strategy. \nPolicy support is now moving from visions and targets to implementation, with specific \npolicies and funding programmes, using various instruments that aim to close the \ncost gap between low-emissions hydrogen and fossil counterparts. In the past year, \nthe equivalent of almost USD 100 billion of public funds have been announced, \nentered into force, or been allocated to specific projects to improve the business case \nfor low-emissions hydrogen. Although nearly two thirds of these funds are only at the \nannouncement stage and are therefore uncertain, they nevertheless indicate \ncommitment from governments and progress towards implementation. The vast \nmajority – 95% – come from advanced economies, whereas EMDEs currently have \nlimited economic incentives for domestic industry development (Figure 6.1). Overall, \nthis funding amounts to only a small fraction of the trillions in investment needed to \nachieve net zero goals, but it is significant given the nascent state of the low-\nemissions hydrogen industry (see Chapter 5. Investment, finance and innovation) \nand the need to both demonstrate deployment under different settings and build \nexperience across diverse geographies. \nPublic funding for the supply side is almost 1.5 times higher than for the demand side. \nThis mirrors a similar disparity across strategies between aims to export and plans to \nimport. Funding related to supply-side policies that have been introduced in the past \n12 months adds up to almost USD 62 billion, while funding for demand-side policies \ntotals USD 40 billion.  \nPublic subsidies are currently the most common instrument used in developed \nmarkets, while tax incentives are common across EMDEs. Direct grants, which can \nbe critical to reducing the CAPEX premium, de-risking investments and obtaining a \nlower cost of capital, are one of the most common instruments. Almost all (99%) of \nthe direct grants were from advanced economies. Almost two thirds of the eleven \ncountries using tax incentives were EMDE. Competitive bidding was used on a more \ngeographically widespread basis, with auctions for hydrogen production carried out \nacross Europe and in India. Incentives covered a wide range, from USD 0.16/kg H2 \n(Denmark, through competitive bidding) to USD 10/kg H2 (United Kingdom, through \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 165  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \ncontracts for difference [CfD]). While direct comparison is complicated by differing \nauction and power market designs, and different electricity prices, among other \nfactors, all bidding processes contribute to market formation, price discovery, and \ncompetition that will drive down costs. Competitive bidding was also common on the \ndemand side, with auctions for the use of hydrogen and ammonia in the power sector \nlaunched or planned in Germany, Japan, Korea and Singapore. \nAlongside the development of certification schemes, governments are working to \nclarify the underlying rules and requirements for hydrogen under their respective \nnational frameworks. The United States is developing guidelines on qualifications for \nhydrogen under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while the European Commission is \ndeveloping a definition of “low-carbon” under the Hydrogen and Gas Decarbonisation \nPackage. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom released an update to its Low-Carbon \nHydrogen Standard, while Kenya put forward its sustainability criteria for “green” \nhydrogen produced in the country.76 Brazil moved ahead with the Brazilian Hydrogen \nCertification Scheme (SBCH2), passing legislation that sets a GHG threshold of \n7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for low-carbon hydrogen. Japan proposed GHG thresholds for \nhydrogen, ammonia, synthetic methane, and synthetic fuels under the Hydrogen \nSociety Promotion Act, with the rules still to be finalised. \nFigure 6.1 Share of public funding linked to hydrogen-related policies by location, status \nand use, 2023 \n \nIEA.

A total of 58 governments, the \nEuropean Union and the Economic Community of West African States (Figure 6.2), \naccounting for more than 84% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, have now \nadopted hydrogen strategies. Strategies are just the first concrete step towards \ndevelopment, and in most cases, they outline the status of and potential for hydrogen \ndevelopment, and announce short-term actions. Only later are they translated into \nspecific legislation and incentives. As such, most of the legislation in place today \nresults from strategies that were announced a couple of years ago, and more recent \nstrategy announcements (Table 6.1) are yet to translate into specific legislations with \nlegally binding targets or defined incentives. \nFigure 6.2 Hydrogen strategies by country and year of first announcement \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJapan \nFrance \nAustralia \nCanada \nBelgium \nAustria \nAlgeria \nIceland \n \n \nKorea \nChile \nColombia \nChina \nArgentina \nEgypt \n \n \n \nEuropean \nUnion \nCzech Republic \nCosta \nRica \nBhutan \nKazakhstan \n \n \n \nGermany \nDenmark \nCroatia \nBrazil \nLithuania \n \n \n \nNetherlands \nHungary \nNamibia \nBulgaria \nTunisia \n \n \n \nNorway \nLuxembourg \nOman \nECOWAS \nViet Nam \n \n \n \nSpain \nMorocco \nSouth \nAfrica \nEcuador \n \n \n \n \nPortugal \nPoland \n \nEstonia \n \n \n \n \nRussia \nSlovak \nRepublic \n \nIndia \n \n \n \n \n \nUnited \nKingdom \n \nIndonesia \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIreland \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIsrael \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKenya \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMalaysia \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMauritania \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNew \nZealand \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPanama \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRomania \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSingapore \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSri Lanka \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTürkiye \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnited Arab \nEmirates \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnited \nStates \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUruguay \n \n  IEA.

Actions focus on \nRD&D, regulatory support and certification. \nBhutan \nElectrolyser target of 5 MW by 2030 and 485 MW by 2050 with investment \nneeds (for production only) of USD 9 million by 2030 and USD 454 million by \n2050. Estimated maximum hydrogen demand of 4.2 ktpa for steel, 12 ktpa for \ncement, and 52.5 ktpa for road transport. \nBulgaria \nRoadmap identifying 18 actions across 4 areas to be implemented before \n2026. Actions include enabling measures such as power market design and \ndevelopment guides for project construction, and deployment targets such as \n10 pilot projects and 2 hydrogen valleys by 2026. \nECOWAS \nRegional production target of 0.5 Mtpa by 2030 requiring 4-5 GW of \nelectrolysis and a cumulative investment of USD 3-5 billion. Hydrogen \nproduction target of 10 Mtpa by 2050. \nEgypt \nTargets 1.5 Mtpa of renewable hydrogen by 2030. Focus on industry, \ntransport and export. 40 Mtpa CO2 emissions reduction resulting from \nhydrogen use by 2040, and GDP growth of USD 10-18 billion. \nEstonia \nRoadmap for hydrogen deployment across three phases until 2050. Targets \nfor the pilot phase (until 2030) include 3-5 hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) \nand 2-40 ktpa of renewable hydrogen. \nIceland \nTargets domestic hydrogen demand in 2030 of 12 ktpa plus another 24 ktpa \nto satisfy 10% of demand from international aviation. Satisfying this with \nrenewable hydrogen would require 237 MW of electrolysis. Investment needs \nfor 2030 of USD 1.8-3.2 billion. 2040 demand is estimated to be ten times \nlarger (with almost 80% from international aviation). \nIndonesia \nStrategy based on three drivers (decarbonisation, energy security, and \nexports), with nine action areas including hubs, hydrogen use in mini-grids \nand power generation, a carbon pricing scheme, and definition of a hydrogen \ncertification scheme. Defines a methodology for establishing priority uses for \nhydrogen based on relevance (for the strategy), impact (expected output) and \nurgency. \nIreland \nPotential demand for 2050 is estimated to be 0.6-2.2 Mtpa with the bulk \n(between 35% and 65%) coming from aviation (for electro-sustainable \naviation fuel [e-SAF]). \nIsrael \nHydrogen demand in 2050 ranging from 580 ktpa to 5.3 Mtpa (equivalent to \n10-100% of Israel’s final energy demand in 2021) with the difference coming \nfrom the power sector. Introduction of a 5.5% combined target for synthetic \nfuels and biofuels by 2033 is under consideration. \nKazakhstan \nConcept note defining broad areas of action for development, with 6 target \nindicators to measure results, including a 10 GW electrolyser target and up to \nKZT 5 trillion (Kazakhstani Tenge) (USD 11.3 billion) of investments in \nhydrogen by 2040 and a 20% share of domestic supply of technologies. \nLithuania \nTargets for 2030 of 1.3 GW of electrolysis (129 ktpa), 30 buses and 10 HRS \n(with at least 1 for shipping), and exports of over 5% of domestic production \nby 2050. Electricity demand for the electrolysers in 2050 estimated to be over \n35 TWh, compared to a current national electricity demand just over 13 TWh. \nMalaysia \nThe hydrogen roadmap goes together with the national energy transition \nroadmap as one of the key levers to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. \nTargets include the phase-out of fossil-based hydrogen, 3.3 Mtpa of \nrenewable hydrogen, and 3 hubs by 2050. An accompanying technology \nroadmap adds more detail. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 168  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nMauritania \nTarget of 1.5% of the global hydrogen market and up to 1% of the global \n“green” steel market by 2050. Explicit production targets for hydrogen, \nammonia, “green” steel, methanol and ammonium nitrate. Hydrogen \nproduction targets of 1.2 Mtpa by 2030 (almost exclusively for exports), \nincreasing to 6.5 Mtpa by 2050 (of which 4.3 Mtpa are for export). \nNew Zealand \nA public consultation on the hydrogen roadmap closed in November 2023 and \nresulting updates will inform the National Energy Strategy, due by end of \n2024. Estimated 2050 demand of 0.6-1.4 Mtpa, requiring 4.5-9.8 GW of \nelectrolysis. Hydrogen is expected to contribute to decarbonisation, economic \ngrowth and energy security. \nRomania \nAction plan for implementation of the roadmap with 33 actions across 4 \nobjectives (decarbonisation; “clean” hydrogen production, skills and \ninnovation; sectoral coupling and renewables integration). 2030 targets \ninclude 34.4 ktpa of renewable hydrogen by 2030, 21 500 heavy- and \nmedium-duty trucks, and 1.6 GW of combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) \ncapacity with 50% renewable hydrogen co-firing. \nTunisia \nTargets 8.3 Mtpa of total hydrogen production and 87 GW of electrolysis by \n2050, including 6 Mtpa for export. Intermediate milestones for 2030 include \n320 ktpa of hydrogen production, 3.9 GW of electrolysis, and 5 GW of \nrenewables. Short-term use is in chemicals and refining, with long-term use in \naviation (e-SAF), shipping and power. Investment needs for 2050 total \nUSD 130 billion. \nUruguay \nEstimated hydrogen production of 1 Mtpa in 2040, requiring 9 GW of \nelectrolysis capacity, with two-thirds of the output exported, and potential \nannual revenue of USD 1.9 billion in 2040. \nViet Nam \nProduction target of 0.1-0.5 Mtpa by 2030 and 10-20 Mtpa by 2050. \nAustralia (update) \n0.5 Mtpa production target by 2030 requiring 3 GW of electrolysis with a \nstretched target of 1.5 Mtpa. Base 2030 export target of 0.2 Mtpa with a \nstretch potential of 1.2 Mtpa. About 30% of the 2030 demand is expected to \ncome from aluminium production. Hydrogen could represent 30% of final \nenergy use in road transport by 2050 and 45% in road freight. \nCzech Republic \n(update) \nUpdate based on the latest market conditions and EU legislation. Strategy is \ndivided into three stages: The first, to 2030, targets 400 MW of electrolysis \nand 20 ktpa of renewable hydrogen. The second, to 2045, focuses on network \ndevelopment. The third focuses on new production pathways. \nSouth Africa \n(update) \nStrategy first published in 2022 approved by the cabinet. Targets include \n1 Mtpa of renewable hydrogen (13 GW of electrolysis) by 2030, increasing to \n4 Mtpa (41 GW of electrolysis) by 2050. Exports are expected to account for \n50% by 2050. Focuses on use of domestic resources (platinum) for 1 GW/yr \nof proton exchange membrane (PEM) manufacturing capacity. Total \ninvestment needs of USD 300 billion by 2050.  \nNotes: See Explanatory notes annex for the use of the term “clean” hydrogen in this report. \n \nNotably, ASEAN member countries have progressed with strategies and targets \nsince the release of GHR 2023. While there are several ongoing projects in the region \n(see Chapters 2-4), only Singapore had a hydrogen strategy at the time of our last \nedition. Since then, Indonesia, Malaysia and Viet Nam have also published national \nhydrogen strategies. All three have decarbonisation as a key driver and an export-\noriented nature, and use a phased approach with different time horizons, each with \ndifferent areas of focus and objectives. Although the strategies differ in their level of \ndetail, all have the overarching aim of identifying enablers for hydrogen development. \nIn addition, several more European countries joined the list of those with hydrogen \nstrategies, including Bulgaria, Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania and Romania. Their \nstrategies largely focus on renewable hydrogen, with Estonia, Lithuania and Romania \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 169  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nhaving set explicit targets. Ireland’s strategy does not set specific targets, but rather \nassesses potential demand, and highlights the country’s offshore wind potential. \nIndustry and transport are common end-uses across strategies, with Romania also \nincluding targets for the power sector. Lithuania’s national strategy for energy \nindependence defines hydrogen targets, including 1.3 GW of electrolysis by 2030 \nand 8.5 GW by 2050 (to produce more than 730 ktpa). Croatia published an \nimplementation plan for its hydrogen strategy, identifying regulatory gaps and priority \nactivities to 2030. In Italy, the National Energy and Climate Plan foresees domestic \nconsumption of renewable hydrogen of 250 ktpa77 by 2030, of which 70% is produced \ndomestically, requiring 3 GW of electrolysis. Portugal has revised its electrolyser \ncapacity target to 3 GW by 2030 (from 5.5 GW) in its public consultation of the \nnational and energy climate plan and in August 2024 Greece revised its target from \n1.7 GW by 2030 (set in 2023) to 187 MW. Germany published its hydrogen import \nstrategy in July 2024. It expects the import share to be 50-70% in 2030. The strategy \nfollows a diversification approach for supply (partners), infrastructure (carriers) and \nproducts (hydrogen derivatives). Germany is also expected to publish its hydrogen \nstorage policy in 2024. \nIn China, several provinces announced plans and targets for hydrogen production \nand road transport, including incentive measures to be used (see Box 6.1). There are \nfew incentives at the national level (other than technology promotion), and financial \nincentives are set by the provinces. \nElsewhere, countries with longer-standing hydrogen strategies turned their attention \nto updates. In December 2023, France issued a document for consultation on their \nstrategy update. This confirms funding of EUR 9 billion (USD 10 billion), of which \nEUR 4 billion is envisioned for CfD. On the supply side, the focus is on electrolytic \nhydrogen, with electrolyser targets of 6.5 GW by 2030 and 10 GW by 2035. The main \npolicy instrument considered for supply is CfD, with annual tenders expected to be \nlaunched in 2024 that will support a total electrolyser capacity of 1 GW by 2026.78 \nThe proposed update also includes undertaking a study to map and assess the \neconomic potential of natural hydrogen by 2025, and a domestic manufacturing \nincentive that is also available for equipment exports. With regards to infrastructure, \nthe proposal includes the development of major hubs (e.g. Dunkirk), 500 km of \ntransmission pipes, HRS every 200 km (to comply with the EU Alternative Fuels \nInfrastructure Regulation), salt cavern storage, and assessment of imports. Similarly, \nChile published a new document that provides more detailed actions for each of the \naction areas identified in its existing hydrogen strategy, with the aim of enabling more \nconcrete progress towards accelerating hydrogen development in the country. \nAustria published a progress report on the implementation of its 2022 hydrogen \nstrategy, in line with its biennial update cycle, and also published a SAF roadmap \ncovering scenarios and 15 actions for the short term to promote SAF ramp-up. \n \n \n77 The 2020 draft had a target of 0.7 Mt/yr. \n78 With additions of 150 MW in 2024, 250 MW in 2025 and 600 MW in 2026. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 170  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nCanada published a progress report covering the project pipeline, incentive schemes, \ndeployment, hubs, priorities, and a comparison of scenarios for hydrogen demand to \n2050. India published a document confirming its 2030 targets, and providing an \noverview of the progress so far and the financial incentives in each state, as well as \nthe financing options available. \nBox 6.1 \nProvincial hydrogen targets in China \nChina produced 28 Mt H2 in 2023 – nearly 30% of the global total. Almost 60% of \nthe hydrogen was produced from unabated coal and a quarter from unabated gas, \ntogether emitting about 400 Mt CO2. At the same time, China has been leading \nglobal hydrogen deployment across electrolysis, synthetic fuels, industry and road \ntransport (see Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand and Chapter 3. Hydrogen production). \nIn March 2022, China published its national Hydrogen Industry Development Plan, \nwith targets for 100-200 ktpa production and deployment of 50 000 fuel cell electric \nvehicles (FCEVs) by 2025. Since then, Chinese provinces have published more \nambitious plans, with targets adding up to 1 200 kt H2, nearly 120 000 FCEV and \nmore than 1 500 HRS by 2025. In 2024, electrolytic hydrogen production from \nprojects that are operational, have reached a final investment decision (FID) or are \nunder construction could total 165 ktpa (see Chapter 3. Hydrogen production), \nsurpassing the national target and reaching almost 15% of the total from provincial \ntargets. At the end of 2023, the FCEV stock stood at 20 600 (see Chapter 2. \nHydrogen demand), 50% up from 2022. A similar pace of growth would be needed \nto meet the national FCEV target by 2025, but 2024 data indicates that growth has \nslowed significantly. As a result, Anhui province has revised its 2025 FCEV target \nfrom 3 000 to 2 000. Similarly, HRS deployment remains far behind the provincial \ntargets, standing at over 400 HRS at the end of 2023. \nThe incentive for provinces to achieve their targets is a financial reward from the \ncentral government (for example, USD 109 million was awarded for the first phase \nof FCEV pilot programmes). Incentives offered by provinces include CAPEX \nsubsidies for HRS (e.g. up to USD 280 000 in Tangshan, Hebei), OPEX subsidies \nfor HRS (USD 2.8/kg H2 for HRS that sell hydrogen below USD 4.2/kg H2), a price \ncap on the hydrogen for FCEV (e.g. USD 4.2kg H2 in Hebei), as well as supply-\nside subsidies such as on OPEX for hydrogen production (e.g. USD 1.4/kg H2 in \nZhangye, Gansu) and lower electricity prices (e.g. a reduction of USD 21-28/MWh \nin Chengdu, Sichuan) as well as CAPEX support for electrolysis (e.g. 30% CAPEX \nin Shenyang, Liaoning). \nInner Mongolia is the region with the most ambitious low-emissions hydrogen \nproduction target: 2.5-5 times the national target and equal to more than one-third \nof the current hydrogen production in the province. Its plans, released in early \n2022, target production of 1.6 Mt by 2025, with a 30% share of renewable \nhydrogen. In early 2023, regional authorities had approved 31 “green” hydrogen \nprojects,* but the development rights for 12 of these, with a total electrolysis \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 171  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \ncapacity of more than 3 GW, were later revoked. Some of the incentives in place \nallow for the establishment of hydrogen projects outside the designated chemical \nindustrial zones, and have limited requirements for licences in addition to subsidies \nfor production and HRS. Among the projects that are already operating or under \nconstruction are a 90 kt project close to Ulanqab that started construction in July \n2024, and the first phase of the Chifeng city project from Envision, which started \noperations in 2023 with the next phase of more than 56 kt to start in 2024.

This is also aligned with the Action \nPlan for Green Development of Shipbuilding Industry (2024-2030), released in \nDecember 2023 by the central government, which focuses on research and pilot \nprojects for hydrogen, ammonia and methanol ships. Shandong targets at least 2 \nvessels with fuel cells by 2025 and more than 30 by 2030. \nQinghai is leveraging its industrial base and has identified 43 renewable hydrogen \nand chemical projects integrating 50 kt of ammonia production, 90 kt of urea, \n120 kt of nitrate molten salts, and 50 kt of methanol. Guangxi is pursuing a broad \napproach, including demonstration of hydrogen production from offshore wind, \nbiomass and nuclear energy; hydrogen blending at the transmission level; fuel cell \ntrucks and ships; and hydrogen for industrial boilers. \n* See Explanatory notes annex for the use of the term “green” hydrogen in this report. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 172  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nDemand creation \nA total of 26 different policies targeting demand creation have been announced since \nthe publication of GHR 2023 (Table 6.2). The most common policy instrument used \nis CAPEX support in the form of grants, although India’s policy, which establishes \nquotas, and Germany’s, which will use carbon contracts for difference (CCfD), are \nnotable exceptions. Public procurement (e.g. for steel) has not been explicitly used \nto trigger hydrogen demand over the past year. Across all the demand-creation \npolicies, applications are most commonly located within hydrogen valleys or hubs. \nAmong the policies that list specific target sectors, industrial uses are most common, \nwhile four countries – Germany, Japan, Korea and Singapore – have announced \nsupport for the power sector. The aviation and shipping sectors are notably absent, \ndespite hydrogen derivatives being essential to decarbonisation in these sectors in \nthe Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) – representing 2% and 9% \nof final energy consumption, respectively, by 2030. Nearly all the funding envisaged \nby these policies comes from developed countries, though India is an exception, with \nUSD 24 million for hydrogen hubs. However, half of the policies and almost 60% of \nthe total public funding is only at the announcement stage and yet to be converted \ninto a binding law. \nThe United States approved almost USD 1.7 billion for six hydrogen-related projects \nas part of the Industrial Demonstration programme. The projects include two \nhydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) plants, a furnace in an ethylene plant that will use \nup to 95% hydrogen, a synthetic ethylene plant, a synthetic methanol plant, and a \nsyngas production plant from liquid by-products. Construction should begin by \nOctober 2026, and up to 50% of the project costs can be covered by the grant. \nOverall, the entire programme (which also covers areas other than hydrogen) has \nannounced public funding of USD 6 billion and is expected to mobilise over \nUSD 20 billion of private capital investment. Of the USD 6 billion in public funding, \nUSD 5.5 billion will come from the IRA, while the remaining USD 0.5 billion comes \nfrom the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  \nIn a separate effort, the US Department of Energy (DoE) announced the winners of \nthe H2Hubs call in October 2023. Seven hubs were selected for negotiation. Once \nnegotiation has been completed, funding will be allocated progressively across four \nphases with 8-12.5 years to full capacity. Three hubs79 have already received total \nfunding of USD 87.5 million for the first phase (detailed planning). The public funds \nallocated amount to USD 7 billion, which is expected to trigger a total investment of \nalmost USD 50 billion. The DoE also announced the H2DI consortium that will \ndesign and implement demand-side support mechanisms in order to facilitate \npurchases of hydrogen produced by the H2Hubs, with the aim of helping to provide  \n \n \n \n79 Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2), the California Hydrogen Hub (ARCHES) and the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen \nHub (ARCH2). \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 173  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nofftake certainty and unlock FID. The measures and implementation plan should be \nready by the end of 2024. Separately, the DoE also announced USD 98 million for \nHRS and research facilities. \nIn Europe, Spain has included renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) \namong the fuels eligible to be used towards meeting renewable targets in the \ntransport sector from 2025 onwards. RFNBO will benefit from having a multiplier of \ntwo in comparison to biofuels, and fuels delivered to aircraft and ships will be worth \n1.2 times as much as road transport fuels. \nElsewhere, Japan has released more information on its proposed hydrogen and \nammonia clusters support scheme to support demand creation in the industry sector. \nThe scope of this support includes infrastructure (storage and transport facilities), and \ncovers different phases of project development, from feasibility studies to \ninfrastructure development. Targets include three large-scale clusters around \nmetropolitan areas, and five medium-scale clusters in regional locations. Assets need \nto have a planned operation of at least 10 years, and operation should start before \n2030. \nIndia launched a tender for hydrogen hubs in August 2024. Up to INR 1 billion (USD \n12 million) of public support will be given to each hub. The target is to have at least \ntwo hydrogen hubs of 100 ktpa each. Projects must reach completion before April \n2026. Australia launched a consultation paper in June 2024 on policies to promote \nthe uptake of low-carbon liquid fuels. Policy instruments under consideration for the \ndemand side include mandates, low-carbon fuel standards and targets, and for the \nsupply side, CfD, grants and production tax incentives. \nThe demand envisaged by demand-side policies and targets remains behind \nproduction targets (Figure 6.3). Demand for low-emissions hydrogen from policies \nalready in force adds up to more than 6 Mtpa by 2030. The European Union leads \nthe way on the basis of mandates introduced by the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU \nMaritime regulations. At the sectoral level, refining has the largest share of demand, \nled by China, Canada, and India, where – despite the absence of specific policies – \nthe committed projects in the pipeline drive demand. Looking forward, on the basis \nof announced government targets, demand could almost double to reach nearly \n10.5 Mtpa by 2030, with half of this growth coming from the transport sector. \nHowever, targets for demand are far lower than targets for production, where the \nUnited States and India alone represent 15 Mtpa by 2030 (10 Mtpa and 5 Mtpa, \nrespectively). \n \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6.

All target renewable hydrogen and could ultimately \nproduce 2.8 Mtpa (with additional investment). \nChile \nAnnounced \nAll \nUp to USD 1 million for demand creation and demonstration of new uses. Up to 60% of costs can be covered. \nChina \nIn force \nIndustry \nThe National Development and Reform Commission issued actions plans for four industry sectors defining \ntargets on efficiency improvement, energy saving and carbon reduction. Plans for refining and ammonia \nexplicitly mention use of renewable hydrogen, without setting explicit targets. By 2025, any capacity below the \nefficiency thresholds (currently 15% of refining capacity and 11% of ammonia capacity) will need to be \nimproved or closed. New-build ammonia plants should use renewable power and hydrogen. \nIndia \nAnnounced \nHubs \nINR 2 billion (Indian rupees) (USD 24 million) during FY2025-2026 to set up at least two renewable hydrogen \nhubs with a minimum size of 0.1 Mtpa. Larger hubs will be given a higher priority (50% of the evaluation \ncriteria). \nIndia \nAnnounced \nIndustry \n5-15% renewable hydrogen quota for the refining sector starting from 2026-2027. Draft regulations are under \nconsultation with stakeholders. State-owned Indian Oil Corporation has set its own target of 50% by 2030. \nItaly \nAnnounced \nIndustry \nEUR 550 million (USD 596 million) and EUR 400 million (USD 434 million) to support investments for the use of \nhydrogen in industrial processes. Established under the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework adopted \nin 2023; resources will come from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. These funds should be granted \nby 2026 and the maximum grant per project is EUR 200 million (USD 217million). \nItaly \nAnnounced \nRail \nEUR 300 million (USD 325 million) to replace diesel trains with hydrogen ones across six regions. \nEUR 24 million (USD 26 million) will be used for the trains and EUR 276 million (USD 299 million) for the \nproduction, storage and fuelling of renewable hydrogen. Projects should be completed by June 2026. \nFrance \nAnnounced \nIndustry \nExtends the TIRUERT scheme* to include “low-carbon” hydrogen in road transport, which is equivalent to an \nincentive of EUR 4.7/kg (USD 5.1/kg). \nGermany \nIn force \nIndustry \nEUR 4 billion (USD 4.3 billion) available in the first round of CCfD, giving 15-year support for fuel switching of \nindustrial assets (i.e. hydrogen is one of several eligible technologies). Winners are expected to be announced \nin Q3 2024. A second round, for EUR 19 billion (USD 20.6 billion), is expected before end of 2024. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter 6.

Proposes starting to set a definition for “green” products in these markets and suggests \npossible instruments like public procurement, product requirements and quotas. \nGermany \nAnnounced \nPower \nTenders for 12.5 GW of hydrogen-ready gas power plants will be launched in 2024/2025. The funds for the \ntender will come from the Climate Transition Fund, which has a total budget of EUR 19.9 billion \n(USD 21.6 billion) for hydrogen and industrial decarbonisation, of which EUR 1.3 billion (USD 1.4 billion) is part \nof the 2024 budget. The first phase includes 5 GW of new plants and 2 GW of refurbishments. The subsidy will \nbe as OPEX for up to 800 hours a year.

Policies \nPAGE | 178  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nMitigation of investment risks \nA total of 16 new policies using direct grants have been announced since \nGHR 2023, adding up to almost USD 18 billion. All these funds come from \nadvanced economies (mostly Europe), except for USD 109 million from China. \nAlmost 70% of these funds are not allocated to a specific call or law. \nIn contrast, 7 of the 11 countries that have introduced tax benefits for hydrogen \ntechnologies are EMDEs. One advantage of this policy measure is that the effect \non the fiscal budget is lower revenue rather than additional cost. This can be \nespecially beneficial in EMDEs, which have a higher cost of capital and have to \npay an additional premium for extraordinary disbursements.  \nIn addition, as a reflection of the growing interest in industrial strategies, the past \nyear has also seen a rise in policies targeting electrolyser manufacturing. Nine \ncountries have now announced such policies, covering up to 60% of the total \ncosts, and – in some cases – introducing local content requirements. \nGrants \nMost of the public funding for grants announced in the last year came from the \nEuropean Union through the Important Projects of Common European Interest \n(IPCEI) and the national Recovery and Resilience Plans (RRP), which were part \nof the COVID-19 recovery programme (NextGenerationEU). At the EU level, two \nnew rounds of IPCEI have been announced since the publication of GHR 2023, \nwith a total public funding of USD 9 billion unlocking USD 9.4 billion of private \ncapital. At the level of EU member states, Germany and Spain gave funding \nnotices to specific projects from the IPCEI rounds, while Finland, Italy, Poland and \nSpain announced funding through RRP. \nThe Dutch Government has allocated EUR 1 billion (USD 1.1 billion) to \nelectrolysis in 2024, to cover up to 80% of the investment cost and provide OPEX \nsupport (up to EUR 9/kg) for up to 10 years, supporting at least 200 MW of \nelectrolysis. EUR 3.9 billion (USD 4.2 billion) are reserved for renewable \nhydrogen in subsequent years. This is part of the EUR 9 billion (USD 9.8 billion) \nthat has been reserved for renewable hydrogen from the Climate Fund. The Dutch \nGovernment also awarded EUR 250 million (USD 271 million) of grants to seven \nrenewable hydrogen projects that add up to a total electrolysis capacity of over \n100 MW. The average subsidy for the winning projects was EUR 2 500/kWel \n(USD 2 711/kWel).80 The total request for subsidies amounted to EUR 600 million \n(USD 651 million), and the projects will have to finish construction by 2028. \n \n \n80 Considering that the maximum size for the application was 50 MWel. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 179  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nCompetitive bidding schemes \nSeveral competitive bidding schemes have been announced and carried out in the \npast year. These span a more diverse range of countries than grants, and include \nauctions for ammonia and refining in India, approval of contracts to award land to \nprojects worth USD 11 billion in Oman, and auctions opened globally under the \nH2Global scheme. They have helped build experience in the countries concerned \nand supported initial steps towards market creation through transparency and \nprice discovery. Given the diversity of auction design, of market and power \nregulation, and of economic conditions, the bid price premiums have varied widely, \nfrom USD 0.16/kg H2 to USD 1.2/kg H2. \nH2Global launched the first (pilot) auction for renewable ammonia, renewable \nmethanol and synthetic kerosene in December 2022, with total funding of \nEUR 900 million (USD 976 million) provided by Germany. The results of the \nauction for renewable ammonia were announced in July 2024. The winner was a \n100 MW project in Egypt powered by 273 MW of onshore wind and solar, and the \nammonia produced will be delivered to the Port of Rotterdam. The guaranteed \nminimum offtake is for 2027-2033 (240 kt), and the total product price was over \nEUR 1 000/t (USD 1 084/t). The project relies on existing infrastructure, \npreventing the need for additional permitting and enabling lower costs. No winners \nwere selected for the synthetic kerosene auction, and its funding will be allocated \nto the renewable methanol auction, though no winners have been announced at \nthe time of writing. Preparations for launching new auctions are underway for \nCanada (with a funding commitment of CAD 300 million (Canadian dollars) \n[USD 220 million] from Canada to be matched by EUR 200 million [USD 217 \nmillion] from Germany), with the aim to launch the tender by the end of 2024. \nAuctions are also being planned for Australia (total funds of EUR 400 million \n[USD 434 million] are under discussion), Germany (with EUR 3.53 billion \n[USD 3.8 billion]), the Netherlands (with EUR 300 million [USD 325 million] for a \njoint window with Germany) and for the United Arab Emirates. The H2Global \nFoundation is also working on a report on auction design to inform policy makers \non how to shape auctions to attain diverse goals. \nThe European Union announced the winners of the first auction of the Hydrogen \nBank (Box 6.2) and approved the third round of IPCEI (Hy2Infra), which will \nsupport up to 3.2 GW of electrolyser capacity and 2 700 km of pipelines, at least \n370 GWh of storage capacity, and port handling capacity for liquid organic \nhydrogen carrier (LOHC) to handle 6 kt of hydrogen-equivalent per year. The \nEuropean Union also selected 42 projects for EUR 424 million (USD 460 million) \nof grant support under the fifth and final selection of the first Alternative Fuels \nInfrastructure Facility call. A total EUR 115 million (USD 125 million) of this \nfunding went to 43 HRS across 7 countries. The first call granted a total of \nEUR 1.3 billion [USD 1.4 billion] (for both electricity and hydrogen) supporting the \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 180  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \ndevelopment of 202 HRS in 2022-2023. The second call opened in February 2024 \nwith a total budget of EUR 1 billion [USD 1.1 billion] (for both electricity and \nhydrogen), and will be open until the end of 2025. \nDenmark awarded DKK 1.25 billion (Danish kroner) (USD 182 million) to \n6 projects for a total electrolyser capacity of 280 MW. Winning bids had price \npremiums \nbetween \nDKK 9.3/GJ \n(USD 0.16/kg H2) \nto \nDKK 67.5/GJ \n(USD 1.2/kg H2), which are relatively low. Some possible reasons for this are \nlower power purchase agreement (PPA) prices in Denmark in comparison to other \nEuropean countries, strategic bidding with risk taking, and a low retention penalty. \nThe auction was oversubscribed more than three times, with total funding \nrequested of DKK 4 billion (USD 581 million) and a total capacity of 675 MW. After \nconclusion of the contracts, the projects will have 4 years to build the construction \nplants. \nIn its auction scheme for renewable hydrogen, India has two separate bidding \nprocesses, known as “modes”. Mode 1 is for a 3-year period, and is open to \nexports. Mode 2 has specific volumes of hydrogen and ammonia, to be used only \nfor domestic consumption, with contracts to be signed for 10 years. The total \nbudget available for hydrogen production (across all modes) is INR 130 billion \n(USD 1.6 billion). For Mode 1, the total bid capacity from the first round was \n551.7 ktpa from 13 bids against an auction target of 450 ktpa, with a final capacity \nawarded \nof \n410 ktpa. \nThe \nincentive \nprovided \nis \nequivalent \nto \nUSD 0.23-0.42/kg H2. Most of the winners plan to export the hydrogen produced \nrather than using it to meet domestic demand. The second round was launched in \nJuly 2024 for 450 ktpa, with the same subsidy caps as the first round \n(USD 0.6/kg H2 the first year, decreasing to USD 0.36/kg H2 in the third year). For \nMode 2, the first round has been launched for 200 ktpa of hydrogen and 750 ktpa \nof ammonia, with the same 3-year subsidy and caps.  \nContracts for difference \nJapan passed the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act, which includes 15-year CfD \nsubsidies for domestic and imported hydrogen production as a supply-side \ninstrument that complements the clusters support scheme for demand. The total \nfunds available are JPY 3 trillion (USD 19.7 billion), which will come from Climate \nTransition Bonds. The programme is open to different technology pathways, as \nlong as the “low-carbon” hydrogen81 threshold is satisfied (70% reduction \ncompared to fossil-based production, which is equivalent to 3.4 kg CO2eq/kg H2). \nThe scheme includes hydrogen and ammonia, with the respective reference \ncommodities of liquefied natural gas and coal. Operation must start before 2030 \nand continue for at least 10 years once the 15-year period has expired. The strike \n \n \n81 See Explanatory notes annex for the use of the term “low-carbon” hydrogen in this report. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 181  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nprice is set based on levelised cost of production (including a profit margin), and \nthe exact price is set at a project level. The scheme is also open to subsidy \nstacking, so export projects could benefit from subsidies in the country of origin \nand this CfD scheme. Public consultation on the scheme design was open until \nSeptember 2024 and a first tender (using a share of the total funds) is expected \nby the end of 2024. \nIn the United Kingdom, the 11 winning projects of the first Hydrogen Allocation \nRound (HAR1) have now been announced. Projects will receive GBP 2 billion \n(USD 2.5 billion) of OPEX support through 15-year contracts, and GBP 90 million \n(USD 114 million) of CAPEX support, subject to the successful signing of the \ncontracts with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (the counterparty for the \nhydrogen production support contracts). This is expected to trigger \nGBP 413 million (USD 525 million) of private capital investment between 2024 \nand 2026. The total electrolysis capacity is 125 MW, with a weighted average \nstrike price of GBP 241/MWh (USD 10.2/kg H2), and first production is expected \n18-24 months after signing the contracts. The total capacity from bids was \n262 MW in comparison to a government target of 250 MW. The government is \nplanning to award contracts to the winning projects by the end of 2024. The \nsecond HAR round was also launched in 2023, aiming to support a capacity of \n875 MW and achieve the ambition of having 1 GW of electrolysis capacity under \nconstruction or in operation by the end of 2025. \nTax incentives \nSeveral tax incentives have been introduced since GHR 2023, predominantly in \nEMDEs. Incentives range from tax refunds to deductions and exemptions. Most of \nthe policies (except for in Australia and Brazil) do not introduce caps on the total \nbudget allocated to the specific measure, and in most there is no public \nquantification of the effects and cost competitiveness. \nAustralia has proposed an AUD 2/kg H2 (USD 1.3/kg H2) production tax incentive \n(similar to the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit under the US IRA), available \nfrom 2027 for up to 10 years, for facilities starting operation by 2030. The total \nfunds are uncapped, but the estimated budget is AUD 6.7 billion (USD 4.4 billion) \nfor 2024 to 2034. The incentive can be used for domestic use and exports, and it \nalso includes ammonia and methanol. Only hydrogen with less than \n0.6 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 (well-to-gate) is eligible. The consultation paper explicitly \nmentions that additionality and hourly matching are not necessary to qualify for \nthe tax incentive. In parallel, the budget of the Headstart programme, which aims \nto bridge the cost gap for first movers using a CfD, has been extended to \nAUD 4 billion (USD 2.6 billion) in total (over 2023-2039). The first round of funding \nfor AUD 2 billion (USD 1.3 billion) for a 10-year period from 2027-28 was open for \nexpressions of interest in October 2023, with six applicants, adding up to 3.5 GW \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 182  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nof electrolysis, shortlisted in December 2023. These two hydrogen initiatives are \npart of a broader programme, Future Made in Australia, aimed at enabling \ninvestment in clean technologies and reaping the benefits of a transition to clean \nenergy. \nOther policy instruments \nOther policy instruments included land allocation for renewable hydrogen (Egypt, \nMorocco, Oman), hydrogen coverage and rules for issuing certificates under \ncarbon pricing schemes (China, European Commission), financing instruments \n(Chile, Japan) and relaxation of local content rules for equipment supply (India). \nOne risk to investment that has largely not yet been covered by any policy relates \nto infrastructure and the need for co-ordination between supply, intermediate \ninfrastructure (pipelines, storage, ports and terminals), and end use (including \nlocal transport). Delays in one part of the supply chain – which may be related to \nthe novel character of some of these steps – could affect other stakeholders \nacross the supply chain. One example of a policy initiative targeting infrastructure \nfor end use is The Canada Infrastructure Bank-approved CAD 337 million \n(USD 248 million) loan to construct 20 HRS in British Columbia and Alberta, of \nwhich 14 will enable the refuelling of 300 heavy-duty vehicles. \n \nBox 6.2 \nFirst auction of the EU Hydrogen Bank \nThe European Union awarded EUR 721 million (USD 780 million) to seven \nrenewable hydrogen projects (five of them in the Iberian Peninsula) in the first \nauction of the European Hydrogen Bank. There were a total of 132 bids, adding \nup to 8.5 GW of electrolysis capacity, and nearly 8.8 Mt of production volume over \n10 years, and an oversubscription of 15 times the budget available. Two-thirds of \nthe projects were planning to use domestically manufactured electrolysers (or a \nmix of domestic production and imports), and over 60% were targeting industry as \nthe end-use sector. The winning projects add up to a total electrolyser capacity of \n1.5 GW, producing nearly 1.6 Mt of hydrogen over 10 years. When annualised, \nthis would be equivalent to almost 4% of the EU Hydrogen Strategy target of \n40 GW by 2030. The winning bids will receive fixed incentives of \nEUR 0.37-0.48/kg H2, in comparison to a levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of \nEUR 5.3-13.5/kg H2, and a ceiling price of the auction of EUR 4.5/kg H2. Potential \nreasons for the low bids are lower LCOH in the countries with awards, strategic \nbidding due to competition across the European Union rather than in a single \ncountry, and higher offtake prices for frontrunners in the downstream uses. The \nindividual grant agreements, in which the winners will commit to developing the \nprojects, are expected to be signed by November 2024, with entry into operation \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 183  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nwithin 5 years. The draft terms and conditions for the next round were also \npublished in April 2024. The budget available for the second round is \nEUR 1.2 billion (USD 1.3 billion). The main changes include a ceiling price of \nEUR 3.5/kg, a maximum period of 3 years to enter operation, and a dedicated \nbudgetary basket for the maritime sector. The “auction-as-a-service” scheme* was \nalso used by Germany, which allocated an additional EUR 350 million \n(USD 380 million) for projects that met the eligibility criteria but did not benefit from \nEU-level support. Austria has also announced the allocation of EUR 820 million \n(USD 890 million) of funds for auctions for renewable hydrogen. EUR 400 million \n(USD 434 million) will be open for bids before the end of 2024, and could use the \nauction-as-a-service scheme in the second funding round. \n*This model simplifies the auction process by using a standardised design for all member states and the same tender \nprocess to enable the funding of additional projects \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter 6.

Over 40% of the funding was for electrolyser manufacturing and 20% \nfor fuel cell manufacturing. This budget is part of the USD 1.5 billion available \nunder the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for R&D and manufacturing. The DoE also \nallocated USD 1.9 billion to 35 clean technology manufacturing projects under the \nQualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) of the IRA. This included \nUSD 337 million for demonstration of advanced manufacturing processes that can \ndecrease costs and increase capacity. Almost one-third of the funding was \nawarded for solid oxide electrolysers (SOEC) to Topsoe and direct CO2 \nelectrolysis in PEM was also included. The Internal Revenue Service issued a \nsecond round of the 48C programme with the concept paper submission expected \nin mid-2024. \nIn Europe, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom have announced \nor put in place specific policies for clean technology manufacturing – including for \nhydrogen production. In the European Union, the Net Zero Industry Act sets a \ntarget of domestic manufacturing capacity of at least 40% of the annual \ndeployment needs in 2030. Electrolyser manufacturers can tap into the general \nbroader funding opportunities such as the Temporary Crisis and Transition \nFramework, which can fund 15-35% of investment costs, the Innovation Fund, \nIPCEI (as already funded through Hy2Tech), and Horizon Europe for novel \nmanufacturing processes. \nIndia has allocated a total of INR 44 billion83 (USD 0.5 billion) for the FY2025-\n2030 period for electrolyser manufacturing. In 2023, the government published \nthe results of its first auction for electrolyser manufacturing, with a total \nauctioned capacity of 1.5 GW/yr, with 20% of domestically developed stack \ntechnology. It received 21 bids for a total capacity of 3.3 GW/yr. There were \neight winning companies, with three of them awarded funding for 0.3 GW/yr \neach.

To put this \ngrowth into perspective, the first phase of Mission Innovation targeted a doubling \nof clean energy RD&D spending over a period of 5 years (across all clean \ntechnologies, which is more difficult to achieve given the larger baseline). For its \nsecond phase, Mission Innovation did not set a specific target, but rather \nrecognises the need to increase clean energy RD&D spending to USD 90 billion \nby 2026, which represents far less ambitious growth than the earlier target of \ndoubling spending. \nFigure 6.4 Government RD&D spending on hydrogen technologies by region, 2018-\n2023 \n \nIEA.

Notably, India launched \nseveral calls to demonstrate hydrogen use in steel, trucks, buses and shipping. \nGovernments are also committing funding to ensuring that communication and \nknowledge-sharing from low-emissions hydrogen RD&D projects is effective and \ntransparent. For instance, the Australian Government funds both the \nCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation HyResearch web \nportal, reporting on 420 RD&D hydrogen-related projects, and the Australian \nRenewable Energy Agency RD&D projects public knowledge-sharing web \nplatform, that reports on results of over 660 projects, of which 10% are hydrogen-\nrelated. \nTable 6.5 Selected government programmes which include support for hydrogen \ntechnology demonstration projects launched since September 2023 \nGovernment \nDescription \nAustralia \nAUD 1.7 billion (USD 1.2 billion) for the Future Made in Australia Innovation \nFund, which includes “green” metals and low-carbon liquid fuels, which can \ninclude hydrogen derivatives. \nChina \nThe Action Plan for Green Development of Shipbuilding Industry (2024-\n2030), released in December 2023, includes research and pilot projects for \nhydrogen, ammonia and methanol in ships and the development of \nhydrogen engines. \nChina \nThe National Energy Administration approved 10 hydrogen projects in 2023, \nincluding PEM electrolysis, HRS and use for power generation. \nEuropean \nUnion \nEUR 173.5 million (USD 123.5 million) across 20 topics covering the entire \nvalue chain (including hydrogen valleys). 151 proposals were submitted, \nwith results announced in August 2024, and 19 proposals were retained for \nfunding. \nIndia \nINR 4 billion (USD 48 million) to promote domestic technology \ndevelopment, funding up to 80% of the total project cost. \nIndia \nINR 4.6 billion (USD 55 million) until FY2029-2030 to demonstrate use in \nexisting blast furnaces and 100% hydrogen in DRI furnaces.

In particular, COP 28 resulted in numerous hydrogen-\nrelated outcomes: \n \nThe International Hydrogen Trade Forum (an initiative that was launched at a G20 \nmeeting in India in 2023 under the umbrella of the Clean Energy Ministerial \nHydrogen Initiative [H2I]), signed a partnership agreement with the Hydrogen \nCouncil.

Brazil’s G20 \nPresidency has defined one of its priorities for the Energy Transitions Working \nGroup as innovative perspectives on sustainable fuels – including hydrogen and \nbiofuels. One of the expected outcomes for this year is a roadmap with policy \nguidelines for accelerating market development for new sustainable fuels, \nincluding hydrogen and its derivatives. In the case of the G7, in their 2024 \nCommuniqué, the Climate, Energy and Environment Ministers committed to \npromote and facilitate the scale-up of investments in the industrial sector for \ninnovative technologies, including low-emissions hydrogen and its derivatives, \nand to strengthen co-operation on low-emissions hydrogen as a key factor of the \nenergy transition for EMDEs, prioritising local energy access and development \nneeds. \nUNIDO is implementing two funding schemes, the Green Climate Fund Readiness \nProgramme and Global Environment Facility - Global Clean Hydrogen \nProgramme. These are expected to support the development of clean hydrogen \nclusters and to help countries with the process of developing enabling policies, \nimproving technical readiness, knowledge management, building capabilities for \nstandards and developing financial mechanisms for the successful uptake of clean \nhydrogen. Most of the activities under these schemes will start in 2025. \nThe IEA H2 TCP and the Clean Hydrogen Mission of Mission Innovation have \nannounced the development of a global research and innovation agenda which \nwill aim to inform governments about priority areas for promoting research and \ninnovation in hydrogen technologies. This initiative could significantly advance the \nalignment of R&D agendas, particularly for end-use hydrogen technologies. \nFurthermore, these two initiatives started a joint study on the future demand of \nhydrogen in industry (Task 48). \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 194  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nCertification, standards, regulations \nStandards, certification and regulation on the \nenvironmental attributes of hydrogen \nCertification (see Box 6.3) is essential to providing evidence on the contribution of \nlow-emissions hydrogen deployment to GHG emissions reduction. Moreover, it is \ncrucial to the development of hydrogen trade, given that traded hydrogen and its \nderivatives cross borders, potentially moving across regions with different \naccounting systems. The last few years have seen rapid progress, with several \ncountries moving from proposing certification schemes, to specifying the rules, \ncriteria and labels. Some have already incorporated these rules into law. However, \nwith the plethora of schemes in place (see Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen \nand its derivatives), there is a risk of incompatibility and additional administrative \nburden as hydrogen is globally traded. The IEA has emphasised the importance \nof mutual recognition between national certification schemes as one of the key \naction areas for policy makers, as have other organisations (e.g. IPHE, UNIDO, \nIRENA), underlining the importance of harmonising schemes and GHG \naccounting methodologies. Several of these efforts are brought together under the \numbrella of the Breakthrough Agenda,87 which has made developing and \nimplementing common standards for the GHG emissions of hydrogen production \none of its priority areas, as well as safety, standards and certification. \n \nBox 6.3 \nKey terminology related to certification  \nThere are several terms related to certification that refer to different concepts, but \nwhich are often used interchangeably. In this section, these terms are used as \nfollows: \nCertification refers to the process of assessing whether a product complies with a \ngiven set of criteria. These may be mandatory requirements, in order to \ndemonstrate compliance with legislation (e.g. the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in \nthe United States), or eligibility for incentives (e.g. the Green Hydrogen Standard \nin India). Alternatively, they can be voluntary, such as reporting progress towards \ndefined targets (e.g. the Climate Bonds Initiative) following disclosure guidelines. \nCertificates can carry information about the origin of the energy used for \nproduction, as well as the time and location. This is usually intended to create \ntransparency for customers. Information disclosed may be limited to the origin of \nthe energy (in which case the certificate is called a “guarantee of origin”), or \n \n \n87 The Breakthrough Agenda was launched at COP 26, and currently with 59 government signatories and 39 specifically for \nthe hydrogen sector. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 195  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nbroader environmental attributes such as land or water use (in which case it is \ncalled a “sustainability certificate”). An example is the EU Renewable Energy \nDirective (RED), which requires disclosure of the origin of the energy (Article 19) \nand aspects relating to broader environmental impact (Articles 29 and 30) leading \nto the emergence of schemes to verify compliance with each of these \nrequirements. \nChain of custody is the name given to the process associated with the change of \nownership of the certificates and correspondence between the certificate and the \ncertified product. In a book and claim model, the certificate is completely \nseparated from the product and can be traded independently. In a mass \nbalancing model, both are directly linked. \nA certification scheme encompasses the governance, application, evaluation, \nenforcement and verification of certificates. This includes the stakeholders (e.g. \nthe issuing body) and their roles, registry and processes. In some cases, legislation \ncomes first, followed by the establishment of certification schemes that in turn \nenable project developers to access incentives associated with legislation. For \nexample, the production tax credit in the United States has set GHG thresholds \nthat projects must comply with in order to access tax incentives, but there is \ncurrently no certification scheme to verify compliance, and final guidelines are still \nbeing defined. In contrast, the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification \nscheme for synthetic fuels was in place before the EU RED legislation was \nfinalised, and the issuing body is now seeking recognition for the scheme from the \nEuropean Commission as a way for projects to demonstrate compliance towards \nRED targets (as are the bodies behind other schemes). \nA labelling scheme can be used to document that a product or production route \nhas satisfied a defined set of criteria established by the certification process, such \nas labels that communicate the emissions intensity of hydrogen production. For \nexample, the “green” hydrogen standard* in India is a label that can be applied to \nhydrogen meeting a threshold of 2 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. \nA technical standard defines a formalised and shared methodology to be used to \nassess certain criteria defined by the certification scheme. This can include \nboundaries, product specifications, GHG accounting rules, and other aspects. The \nISO Technical Specification is one example. \nElsewhere in this report, the term “certification” may be used to encompass several \nof the above aspects in order to facilitate understanding. \n* See Explanatory notes annex for the use of the term “green” hydrogen in this report. \n \nImportant progress towards harmonisation and alignment was achieved at \nCOP 28, with the launch of the Technical Specification for the methodology for \ndetermining the GHG emissions associated with the production and transport of \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 196  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nhydrogen (ISO/TS 19870:2023). This was based on the methodology proposed \nby the IPHE and will be used as the basis for a multi-part series covering the \nhydrogen supply chain from production to consumption gate. The international \nstandard for hydrogen production should be finalised in 2025, and the standards \nfor GHG emissions from ammonia, LOHC, and liquid hydrogen in 2026. In \naddition, at COP 28, a Declaration of Intent for the mutual recognition of \ncertification schemes for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and hydrogen \nderivatives was signed by 37 governments. This effort is intended to drive \nconvergence towards a minimum set of fundamental design principles for \ncertification schemes, and to prevent a potential fragmentation that could delay \nthe emergence of a global market, as well as increasing investor confidence. \nSignatories commit to seek accelerated technical solutions to enable mutual \nrecognition of the schemes, including co-operation through the IPHE and the IEA \nH2 TCP, and the adoption of globally recognised standards such as the \nforthcoming ISO methodology. \nIn the United States, the Internal Revenue Service released the proposed rules to \naccompany the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (45V) in December 2023. \nThe rules specify how to determine the lifecycle GHG emissions from hydrogen \nproduction and the conditions the electricity input needs to satisfy to produce what \ncan be categorised as “clean” hydrogen.88 GHG emissions should be estimated \nusing the 45VH2-GREET tool, using a well-to-gate approach (i.e. including \nupstream emissions and without emissions from construction). Energy attribute \ncertificates can be used to document the use of renewable electricity for \nelectrolysis, and requirements for incrementality, temporal matching and \ndeliverability must be fulfilled. These requirements are well aligned with those set \nin the European Union, with a maximum 36-month period between the operation \nof the renewable electricity input and the electrolyser beginning operations \n(incrementality), annual correlation between the renewable electricity and the \nhydrogen production until 2028 (when hourly correlation will become necessary \n[temporal matching]), and the same bidding zone for the renewable facilities and \nthe electrolyser (deliverability). Furthermore, in June 2024, the Internal Revenue \nService finalised rules for wage and apprenticeship requirements that can further \nincrease the credit from USD 0.6/kg H2 to USD 3/kg H2. Guidelines for the tax \ncredit itself are still to be finalised. \nIn the European Union, the RED Amendment entered into force on November \n2023, and member states have until May 2025 to transpose it into national \nlegislation. In addition, in May 2024, the European Council adopted the Hydrogen \nand Decarbonised Gas Package, which defines low-carbon hydrogen as needing \nto meet a 70% GHG reduction in comparison to the fossil fuel benchmark \n \n \n88 See Explanatory notes annex regarding the use of the term “clean” hydrogen in this report. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 197  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \n(94 g CO2-eq/MJ). Details on the specific conditions, methodology to quantify \nGHG emissions and criteria are deferred to a Delegated Act that should be \npublished within 12 months of the package entering into force (i.e. by June 2025). \nThe European Union and Japan also announced intentions to co-operate to \npromote renewable and low-carbon hydrogen globally and ensure that standards \nand regulation converge. \nMeanwhile, Denmark recognised the scheme from International Sustainability and \nCarbon Certification for the certification of renewable hydrogen. This was done as \na temporary measure to avoid delays in project development while waiting for the \nlist of recognised schemes by the European Commission.  \nGermany and France transposed the EU Delegated Acts for RFNBO into national \nlegislation. In Germany, the updated regulation introduces a system for providing \nevidence of compliance with the requirements for the production and delivery of \nliquid and gaseous RFNBO. The certification of suppliers follows a similar process \nto the existing Biofuel Sustainability Ordinance. \nIn Spain, from 2025, hydrogen and its derivatives will count towards reaching the \ntarget of 29% of renewable energy in transport set in the revised EU RED. The \nsame Ministerial Order that introduced this policy also modifies the guarantees of \norigin scheme for renewable gases to include sustainability criteria and CO2 \nemissions reduction data, as well as requirements to account for the renewable \nelectricity used in hydrogen derivatives. \nIn Portugal, the electricity and gas grid operator (REN) started issuing guarantees \nof origin (GoO) for renewable hydrogen in July 2024. This will be harmonised with \nthe schemes in other EU member states by the end of 2024, which will enable \nthese GoO to be used with imports and exports within the European Union. \nThe United Kingdom published an updated version of the Low Carbon Hydrogen \nStandard in December 2023. Updates include a refinement of key requirements \nfor electrolysers, including a definition of eligible PPA, renewable energy GoO \nrequirements, calculation of transmission and distribution losses, requirements for \nelectricity storage systems, the addition of methane pyrolysis, and updated \nmethodologies. This standard defines the criteria for projects to be able to apply \nfor the Hydrogen Production Business Model (OPEX) support while the \ngovernment is working on a Low Carbon Hydrogen Certification Scheme, which \nshould be published by 2025. \nIn China, guidelines released in October 2023 for GHG reporting for industrial \nassets could give an indication of future guidance for hydrogen. Off-grid non-fossil \nelectricity is considered to have zero emissions, while emissions from non-fossil \nfuel electricity are calculated using the national grid emission factor from 2022 set \nat 570 g CO2/kWh, and “green certificates” cannot be used for emission offsets. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 198  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nJapan has proposed GHG thresholds under the Hydrogen Society Promotion Act. \nThresholds \ninclude \n3.4 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 \nfor \nhydrogen \n(well-to-gate), \n0.87 kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 for ammonia (well-to-gate), 49.3 g CO2-eq/MJ for \nsynthetic methane (well-to-point of consumption) and 39.9 g CO2-eq/MJ synthetic \nfuels (well-to-point of consumption). The CO2 source should be biogenic, from \ndirect air capture, or should be covered by agreements to avoid double counting \nof emissions (e.g. allocating the emissions to the original emitter). These rules are \nyet to be finalised. \nIn Latin America, 14 governments reached an agreement to work on a common \ncertification scheme known as “CertHiLAC” for clean and low-carbon hydrogen. \nThis initiative is receiving support from the Inter-American Development Bank and \nthe Latin American Energy Organization. A group comprising national \nrepresentatives was formed to establish a governance structure for the \nagreement, define relevant stakeholders, and issue recommendations. In Peru, a \nlaw was published defining “green” hydrogen as hydrogen produced using \ntechnologies with low GHG emissions. The law also makes the Ministry of Mines \nand Energy responsible for defining the criteria for certifying the GoO of the green \nhydrogen. In Brazil, the government has finalised the rules of the Brazilian \nHydrogen Certification Scheme (SBCH2), including definitions and a governance \nstructure. The rules set a GHG threshold of 7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 to define low-\ncarbon hydrogen, but additionality criteria for the renewable electricity was not \nincluded following its rejection by the Senate. Further details, such as on chain of \ncustody, scope, criteria and instruments, will be defined in subsequent legislation. \nThe scheme will be voluntary for producers, and the need for international \ncollaboration and harmonisation of standards is also emphasised. The operator of \nthe electricity market (CCEE) has manuals on governance, methodology and \ncriteria for the certification of hydrogen and derivatives, and used these to certify \ntwo projects in 2023. Only electrolysis is included in the CCEE scheme. With \nregards to scope and criteria, the scheme covers both on- and off-grid \nconfigurations, includes indirect emissions from electricity, and requires more than \n90% renewables, emissions lower than 18 g CO2/MJ, and a PPA with additionality, \na monthly correlation and geographical correlation. \nElsewhere, Kenya issued guidelines for the sustainability criteria for “green” \nhydrogen and derivatives. Sustainability is defined in terms of electricity source89, \nwater, land and local communities. Guidelines on health and safety, project \nregistration, local content, incentives, commencement date, transition and \ncomplaints handling are also provided. The renewable hydrogen production must \nhave well-to-gate lifecycle emissions of less than 1 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 and \n \n \n89 Three sourcing options are considered: (1) captive renewable supply; (2) grid connection with at least 80% renewable \nsupply in a calendar year and with an average grid emission intensity below 64.8 g CO2/kWh during the previous calendar \nyear; and (3) Supply from a remote renewable plant by using PPA and renewable energy certificates. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 199  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \n0.3 kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 in the case of ammonia, averaged over a 12-month period. \nQualitative targets are defined for most criteria, except for the GHG thresholds \nand the criteria for the electricity input. \nIn Australia, consultation on the scheme design and the emissions accounting \napproach to be used was undertaken prior to October 2023, and final legislation \nintroducing a GoO scheme should be in place by July 2025. Australia is also \nconsidering extending the GoO scheme to cover the production of low-carbon \nliquid fuels (including synthetic fuels) and it has allocated AUD 18.5 million \n(USD 12.2 million) from the federal budget 2024-2025 to this initiative over the \nnext 4 years. \nThe United Arab Emirates is working on developing a low-carbon certification \nscheme through the Hydrogen Taskforce as a follow-up to its hydrogen strategy. \nThe certificates are expected to be voluntarily tradeable and to carry energy, \nenvironmental, and social attributes. \nAmong the new strategies published in the last year, Indonesia’s strategy notably \ndefines a certification scheme as a critical component of a clear regulatory \nframework to promote hydrogen deployment. \nOperational and safety standards  \nIn 2024, the ISO Technical Committee 197 published two new standards: (ISO \n19880-9:2024) on sampling for fuel quality analysis at HRS and (ISO 19885-\n1:2024) on fuelling protocols of gaseous hydrogen for passenger vehicles. There \nare 21 standards published so far and 26 under development, of which the majority \nare related to fuelling stations, fuelling protocols and vehicle fuelling system \ncomponents. Ten standards have now reached the status of Draft International \nStandards and one has reached the Final Draft International Standard stage. \nIn addition, the International Electrotechnical Commission has published 34 \nstandards so far (including 6 since the publication of GHR 202390) relating to the \nsafety of fuel cell modules, performance test methods, and micro fuel cell power \nsystems.  \nThe IPHE performed a gap assessment of regulations, codes and standards \n(RCS) for large-scale storage of hydrogen to identify the critical areas for research \nand regulation to enable the large-scale deployment of bulk hydrogen storage. \nThe report mapped the RCS in nine countries for above-ground and underground \ntanks, and for subsurface storage. Common gaps across countries included \nmaximum storage sizes that are insufficient for the large-scale storage needs \n \n \n90 IEC 62282-2-100:2020/COR1:2023; IEC 62282-4-202:2023; IEC 62282-6-101:2024; IEC 62282-6-106:2024; IEC 62282-6-107:2024; IEC \n62282-8-201:2024. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6.

Importantly, \nin some cases hydrogen was either absent from the regulations or fell under the \nscope of different legislations. \nIn November 2023, UNIDO organised the ISO Hydrogen Technologies Plenary \nWeek, which convened over 150 global experts representing 62 countries, \nincluding 34 EMDEs, and is now supporting the development of a framework for \nquality infrastructure along the renewable hydrogen supply chain. This will include \na practical guide for the use of the ISO methodology by industry and government \nstakeholders. The guide will be used for capacity-building activities expected to \nbegin in the second half of 2024. \nAt a regional level, in 2024, the United States is focusing on identifying and \naddressing permitting challenges, understanding and addressing indirect impacts \nof hydrogen releases, materials compatibility, and the advancement of sensor \ntechnologies (through R&D). The United States already has a tool to help projects \nnavigate relevant codes and standards. Canada will complete a Codes and \nStandards roadmap in 2024, identifying and prioritising any gaps to be resolved to \nsupport hydrogen development. \nIn the European Union, an RCS Strategy Coordination Task Force will be set up \nin 2024, composed of the European Commission, the Clean Hydrogen Alliance, \nand Hydrogen Europe. The Task Force aims to enhance European engagement \nwith international RCS bodies, and to support the Commission in working on \nstandardisation with IPHE and the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM). A report on \ninternational RCS developments is planned for publication by the end of 2024. \nAt the national level, in July 2024 Germany launched a strategic roadmap for the \nexpansion and adaptation of the technical regulations for hydrogen technologies. \nIn the Netherlands, the safety standards for ammonia storage and loading are now \nbeing revised in phases, and the final version of the first phase, applicable to new \nfacilities, was published in July 2024. In the United Kingdom, the government aims \nto work with industry in 2024 to ensure the regulatory framework is fit for purpose \nfor hydrogen along the value chain. \nIn other regions, Australia is developing national hydrogen codes of best practice \nfor hydrogen and ammonia production and appliances, which will cover hydrogen \nproduction, refuelling and storage safety. These codes aim to provide clarity on \nthe regulatory obligations for projects, the regulators involved in the different steps \nof the process, and timing and cost of compliance. Co-design workshops between \ngovernment and industry were held in late 2023, with public consultation expected \nto take place in 2024. The government maintains lists of the regulations and \nstandards that each part of the value chain should comply with. In April 2024, \nNew Zealand launched a public consultation to adopt 13 hydrogen-related ISO \ntechnical standards.  \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6. Policies \nPAGE | 201  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nRegulations on infrastructure, permitting and other areas \nIn the European Union, the Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Package was \nadopted in May 2024, after the Commission first proposed it in December 2021. \nThis defines the governance of the hydrogen transmission network in the \nEuropean Union, noting that a 10-year development plan will be published every \n2 years starting from 2026, and setting a maximum of 2% (by volume) hydrogen \nblend for cross-border gas infrastructure in case member states cannot come to \nan agreement. Member states have until mid-2026 to transpose the new rules into \nnational law. \nGermany passed regulatory frameworks for hydrogen network development and \nits financing. The network is to be financed by the private sector, with fees that are \ncapped to avoid high initial costs that could prevent market development. The fees \nhave a deferral scheme, in which fees in the early years will be lower than the \nactual costs to promote market ramp-up. To ensure liquidity, there are extra \npayments from the government to ensure a pre-tax nominal return on equity of \n6.69%. The European Commission approved EUR 3 billion (USD 3.3 billion) of \nGerman state aid to be provided as a government guarantee and will allow \ntransmission system operators to obtain more favourable loans. The German \nGovernment also presented the draft Hydrogen Acceleration Act, which aims to \ndigitalise, simplify and prioritise planning, approval and procurement procedures. \nThis includes setting maximum deadlines for approval procedures, shortening \nappeal processes, and reducing administration. It will cover hydrogen production, \npipelines, port terminals, ammonia cracking, and power lines supplying \nelectrolysers. Elsewhere, in Denmark, the government reached an agreement on \nthe economic framework conditions for hydrogen infrastructure91 and the \nprinciples and conditions for state risk hedging. Spain granted a provisional \nauthorisation to Enagas (the gas transmission system operator) to develop \nhydrogen networks recognised under the European Projects of Common Interest. \nThe United Kingdom announced support in principle for a hydrogen core network \nfollowing the recommendation of the National Infrastructure Commission. The \ngovernment published a strategic planning document in December 2023, and \nplans to open a consultation in 2024 for specific activities, with the system operator \nformally becoming responsible for network planning from 2026. A Regulated Asset \nBase emerged as preferred financing model of the network in the public \nconsultation, with a revenue floor for 15 years for storage assets. Given the current \nlack of overarching regulation for the network, the government has extended the \nexisting offshore oil and gas pipeline and storage regulatory frameworks to cover \noffshore hydrogen pipelines and storage. In parallel, a market consultation for the \n \n \n91 Including regulated third-party access, no tariff exemption for individual (types of) users, and 10% of network capacity \nreserved for short-term contracts. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 6.

The government also announced its support for blending up \nto 20% hydrogen (by volume) in the gas distribution network in certain scenarios \nand circumstances. A position on blending in the transmission network is expected \nin 2024, and before a decision is taken, the HyDeploy industry trials will provide \nfurther evidence. There will be a safety review, and a report assessing economic \nsupport will be prepared. The government also launched the Track-1 expansion \nprocess of HyNet in December 2023 for a CO2 storage capacity of \n1.3-1.5 Mtpa CO2 from 2028 (in which hydrogen is one of several relevant \nsectors), contributing to the 20-30 Mtpa CO2 target for 2030. Winners will be \nannounced in Q3 2024, with FID expected by 2026, and latest operating date by \nthe end of 2030. \nElsewhere, in March 2024, Australia finalised a process of extending the national \ngas law and regulations to include hydrogen with the amendment of the National \nGas Rules and the National Energy Retail Law. Israel granted a permit to allow \nthe natural gas transmission operator to engage in the transportation of hydrogen \nand CO2.\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 203  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nChapter 7. GHG emissions of \nhydrogen and its derivatives \nHighlights \n \nIn 2023, global hydrogen production emitted 920 Mt CO2. Nearly two-thirds of \nproduction was from unabated natural gas, which emits 10-12 kg CO2-\nequivalent (CO2-eq)/kg H2; about 20% was from unabated coal, which emits 22-\n26 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. Between 75% and 95% of these emissions occur directly \nat the point of production, and can be reduced by carbon capture, utilisation and \nstorage (CCUS). For hydrogen from steam methane reforming (natural gas), \nabatement costs are estimated at around USD 60-85/t CO2 for capture rates of \n55-70%, and USD 85-110/t CO2 for rates above 90%. However, carbon capture \nalone is not sufficient; upstream and midstream emissions must also be tackled.  \n \nHydrogen from electrolysers is emissions-free at the point of production, and so \nemissions depend on the electricity used. Emissions intensity from electricity \ngeneration should be below 200-240 g CO2/kWh for emissions to be lower than \nsteam methane reforming. Renewable electricity is emissions-free at the point \nof generation, but embedded emissions can occur in the construction and \nmanufacturing of renewable assets. Such emissions are currently not included \nin most standards and schemes; they can range from 0.4-2.7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. \n \nThe process of converting hydrogen to a carrier for transport incurs energy \nlosses of 45-70%. This means that any GHG emissions from the electricity input \nto the electrolysers increases by a factor of 2-3 in terms of the final hydrogen \ndelivered. The lowest emissions are achieved when the electrolyser uses \nrenewable electricity, and the hydrogen transported is used as shipping fuel and \nno fossil fuels are used in hydrogen recovery. Liquid hydrogen results in the \nlowest emissions due to its higher pathway efficiency (above 50%); emissions \nare slightly higher for liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) and ammonia. \n \nThe emissions reduction offered by carbon-containing hydrogen-based fuels is \ngreatest when the CO2 source is biogenic or from the air. The emissions \nintensity of their electricity input should be lower than 160-190 g CO2-eq/kWh \nfor synthetic methanol and 95-140 g CO2-eq/kWh for synthetic methane and \nkerosene to result in lower emissions compared to a fossil fuel. In emissions \naccounting, the way CO2 emitted during fuel combustion is allocated along \nprocessing steps in the supply chain has a large effect on the total emissions \nallocated to the individual product. \n \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 204  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nOverview \nIn 2023, global production of 97 Mt of hydrogen emitted92 nearly 920 Mt CO2 (Chapter \n3. Hydrogen production). This is equivalent to the annual energy-related emissions \nof Indonesia and France combined. In the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario \n(NZE Scenario), these emissions must go down by around 10% to 820 Mt CO2/yr by \n2030. At the same time, in this scenario total hydrogen production needs to increase \nby over 50% to 150 Mtpa, which means that the reduction required in terms of specific \nemissions is more significant than in absolute terms, with a 40% drop needed by 2030 \nto reach ~5.5 kg CO2/kg H2. \nA hydrogen molecule does not contain any carbon, which means the CO2 emissions \ndo not come from the end use, but rather from the production, processing and \ntransport of hydrogen. Carbon accounting must therefore track the CO2 emissions at \neach conversion step in the supply chain. The framework used to account for and \nreport on GHG emissions is of critical importance for the trade of low-emissions \nhydrogen, especially as traded hydrogen may cross borders and jurisdictions, and \nthe majority of the GHG emissions occur upstream in the supply chain, during \nproduction and transportation. \nA large number of certification schemes and regulations (see Box 6.3 for clarifications \non certification-related terminology) have emerged in the past 3 years (see Figure \n7.1), using different boundaries, production routes, definitions, emissions thresholds \nand methodologies for varying products. Nevertheless, there have been signs of \nconvergence in the past year. The publication of the International Organization for \nStandardization (ISO) Technical Specification for the hydrogen supply chain from \nproduction to consumption gate will set the basis for the ISO standards to be \npublished in the next 2 years. At the multilateral level, the COP 28 Declaration of \nIntent on mutual recognition of certification schemes, and regional efforts in Latin \nAmerica for a common certification scheme (CertHiLAC) demonstrate strong \ncommitment to establishing common standards. The IEA H2 Technology \nCollaboration Programme (TCP) Task 47 and the International Partnership for \nHydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE) Hydrogen Certification Mechanisms \n(H2CM) Task Force are two global initiatives that have joined efforts to develop an \nevidence base on the current certification mechanisms and to support building \nconsensus and mutual recognition across schemes. These efforts must continue in \norder to ensure that accounting is carried out based on a common methodology for \ntracking lifecycle emissions as hydrogen crosses borders. \nExisting certification schemes currently use a wide range of emission thresholds and \nlabels (Figure 7.1). More than half of the schemes require an emissions intensity \n \n \n92 Considering 0 kg CO2/kg H2 for hydrogen produced as a by-product in naphtha crackers and steam crackers. Considering a \nmaximum of 10 kg CO2/kg H2 emissions would increase up to 1 070 Mt CO2. This includes direct emissions from hydrogen \nproduction and close to 300 Mt of CO2 utilised in the synthesis of urea and methanol, the majority of which is later emitted. This \nexcludes upstream and midstream emissions for fossil fuel supply \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 205  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nlower than 4 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2, which is 60-70% lower than the 10-12 kg CO₂-eq/kg \nH2 from unabated natural gas, the most common production route today. Of the \nschemes that allow higher thresholds, six are part of a programme aiming to reduce \nCO₂ emissions in road transport, where the lower conversion efficiency of internal \ncombustion engines (in comparison to fuel cells) means higher emissions from \nhydrogen production and transport could still lead to a net emissions benefit \n(comparing hydrogen use with the incumbent fossil fuel), which explains the use of \nhigher thresholds. Another scheme with a threshold higher than 4 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2 is \nused in China, where nearly 60% of hydrogen is produced from unabated coal, which \ncan have emissions of 22-26 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2. Brazil has recently passed legislation \napproving an emissions threshold of 7 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2, more than double the \nthreshold in the European Union, and 3.5 times the threshold of India. At the lower \nend, Australia has proposed a threshold of only 0.6 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2 for its Hydrogen \nProduction Tax Incentive (HPTI), which aims to promote the development of \nrenewable hydrogen and should be in place by July 2027. In addition to hard limits, \nseveral countries apply schemes with tier systems to define several emissions \nthresholds, which are associated with progressive financial incentives for producers \nwith lower emissions. \nAll schemes (except for in the European Union, the UK Renewable Transport Fuel \nObligation and H2Global) that have a threshold below 4 kg CO₂-eq/kgH2 are well-to-\ngate in their scope. Hydrogen that is traded globally will have higher specific \nemissions due to transport and conversion, which means that well-to-wheel schemes \nthat have the same threshold as well-to-gate schemes pose more stringent \nrequirements for hydrogen producers, as transport and distribution emissions are \nalso included. \nOnly two schemes cover hydrogen-based fuels exclusively. One is from H2Global, \nwhich is a programme started by the German government aimed at imports. The \nprogramme covers well-to-point of delivery and its threshold is similar to others at \n3 kg CO₂-eq/kg H2. The other is a voluntary scheme by the Ammonia Energy \nAssociation, originally proposed in 2021 and currently under development. In total, \nten schemes (of which five are regulatory) cover both hydrogen and its derivatives. \nSeven (three regulatory) of these are already operational. European schemes do not \ndefine a specific production route, and only specify a GHG threshold that any \nhydrogen (or derivative) should achieve, as well as the methodology to be used. \nAmmonia is most common among schemes that explicitly mention the carriers.

Emissions associated with the electricity input and \nupstream and midstream methane emissions are included. Emissions from \nconstruction, manufacturing, and decommissioning of assets are excluded from the \nscope, but their quantification should be provided separately for information. With a \nwell-to-gate scope, only the end use is excluded. \nThe ISO Technical Specification currently covers hydrogen carriers that are expected \nto be reconverted back to gaseous hydrogen (liquefied hydrogen, LOHC and \nammonia), including cases where they are used directly (as for ammonia). Carbon-\ncontaining synthetic fuels such as methane, methanol and other hydrocarbons are \nexcluded from the scope. These can be used directly as fuels due to their higher \nvolumetric energy density (compared to pure hydrogen carriers) and existing \ninfrastructure that facilitates transportation to the end use. \nGlobal warming potential (GWP) (which covers GHG emissions) is one of several \ncategories typically covered in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis. The rest of \nthis chapter will focus only on GHG emissions, but the total environmental impact of \nhydrogen must be assessed considering criteria across all the impact categories. \nBeyond the environmental aspect, other dimensions such as social aspects or cost \ncan necessitate trade-offs when designing a plant or making a final investment \ndecision on a project, but these factors are not included in this analysis. \nSupply chain efficiency is defined in this report as the energy finally delivered as \nhydrogen compared to the total energy input along the supply chain. As a result, \ndesign changes, like the use of hydrogen that has been transported to provide the \nheat for ammonia cracking and LOHC dehydrogenation, or as a shipping fuel, will \ndecrease the efficiency (and increase the specific GHG emissions), since this \nhydrogen consumption along the chain reduces the hydrogen finally delivered. \n \n \n \n \n93 GHG emissions for all transport operations, hub operations, and storage for transport by inland waterway, pipeline, rail, road \nand sea. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

This section focuses on hydrogen production, meaning that the scope is \nwell-to-gate. \nFor production pathways using natural gas and coal without carbon capture and \nstorage (CCS),94 direct emissions during hydrogen production represent as much as \n75-95% of the total emissions. Hydrogen produced from natural gas emits \n \n \n94 For the analysis in this chapter, only carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been considered, since the ISO Technical \nSpecification does not consider carbon capture and use (CCU) among the included hydrogen production routes. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

CC BY 4.0. \n10-12 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, with the range coming from the difference in upstream and \nmidstream GHG emissions95 (Figure 7.3). Emissions from hydrogen production from \ncoal are higher, at 22-26 kg CO2-eq/kg H2.  \nCCS can be used to reduce the direct emissions, with the capture rate and abatement \ncost depending on the technology pathway and the point of capture. Capture rates \nfor steam methane reforming (SMR) are the lowest (55-70%) when carried out only \nin the concentrated stream on the process side, which also results in the lowest \nabatement cost (USD 60-85/t CO296). When capture is also implemented on the flue \ngas, which is more diluted and has lower pressure, the capture rate can increase \nabove 90%, but the cost also increases to USD 85-110/t CO2. Process modelling \nstudies have shown that plant capture rates of 96% and up to 99% can be technically \nand economically feasible. Using electricity instead of natural gas to achieve the high \ntemperatures needed for reforming is also an option, but this would tackle only the \nemissions from fuel combustion, which are around 45% of the total, and therefore \nmitigation of the emissions from the process side would still be required. For \nautothermal reforming, capture rates can be 93-98% since most of the CO2 is on the \nprocess side at high pressure. The gas partial oxidation (POx) process developed by \nShell is reported to yield overall plant capture rates up to 99%, although these high \ncapture rates are yet to be proven in large-scale commercial plants on a continuous \nbasis.  \nOnce CCS is implemented, the upstream and midstream GHG emissions become \nthe dominant factor, accounting for up to 98% of the total emissions when partial \noxidation of natural gas with 99% capture is applied. Upstream and midstream GHG \nemissions can make up to 90% of the total for production from coal (when a 98% \ncapture rate is applied), due to higher residual emissions from carbon capture. \nFor production using natural gas, the global average upstream and midstream \nemission intensity in 2022 was 11.3 kg CO2-eq/GJNG,97 which corresponds to 20% of \nthe CO2 produced during the combustion of the natural gas, and is equivalent to about \n1.8 kg CO2-eq/kg H2.98 These emissions alone would be four times higher than the \nlowest threshold defined in the production tax credit in the United States (0.45 kg CO2-\neq/kg H2) and 60% of the threshold defined in the EU Taxonomy. There is a wide \nspectrum of natural gas emissions intensity around the world. At the lower bound, \nNorway has an upstream and midstream emissions intensity of 4.5 kg CO2-eq/GJNG \n(0.7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2), compared to up to 27 kg CO2-eq/GJNG (4.3 kg CO2-eq/kg H2) \nfor Turkmenistan. The solutions to mitigate upstream and midstream emissions are \n \n \n95 This includes CO2 and methane emissions occurring during the production, transport and processing of the fuels. \n96 For merchant plants, i.e. where hydrogen production is not integrated with a specific process. \n97 If not specified otherwise, energy amounts are based on lower heating values. \n98 Assuming an efficiency of 75%. This could increase to 3.8 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 if a 20-year time horizon is used for the global \nwarming potential instead of 100 years. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 210  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nknown and cost-effective. In the NZE Scenario, the global average upstream and \nmidstream emissions intensity of natural gas would be halved by 2030. \nReliable methane emissions inventories are critical to establish baselines, define \ntargets and track progress. National emission inventories are known to underestimate \nthese emissions, but other efforts in recent years have made progress in closing this \ngap. Clear and standardised measurement, monitoring, reporting and verification \n(MMRV) guidelines are also essential to ensure the interpretation of the emissions \nmeasured. For example, in 2020 the United Nations Environment Programme \n(UNEP) launched the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (its flagship oil and gas \nreporting and mitigation programme), which has developed guidance for methane \nmeasurement. The EU Methane Regulation introduces mandatory MMRV \nrequirements on domestic producers and establishes a transparency platform with \ncountry profiles (including non-EU member states exporting to the European Union). \nThere are also government efforts aiming to measure and reduce these emissions \nlike the Global Methane Pledge, which is supported by countries covering 50% of \nglobal anthropogenic emissions and targets 30% reduction by 2030 (compared with \n2020). In November 2023, the US Department of Energy (DoE) announced an \ninternational working group, composed of 14 members, to establish an MMRV \nframework for providing comparable and reliable information to natural gas market \nparticipants. \nFor production using coal, upstream and midstream emissions can make even a \nlarger difference. Even with a capture rate of 98%, the upper end of upstream and \nmidstream emissions would result in total emissions from hydrogen production above \n5 kg CO2-eq/kg H299 (for coal), which is more than half the most common \nconventional production route today (from natural gas) and above most low-carbon \nthresholds that have been defined in certification schemes (see Chapter 6. Policies). \nFor hydrogen production using water electrolysis, emissions are largely defined by \nthe electricity input. Due to the conversion efficiency of the electrolysis process, every \n100 g CO2/kWh associated with electricity supply results in nearly 5 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 \nin hydrogen production.100 This means that the emissions intensity of the electricity \ninput needs to be lower than 200-240 g CO2/kWh to breakeven with the unabated \nnatural gas route. There is a large range around the world: Countries that have a high \nshare of hydropower today (e.g. Norway, Paraguay, Switzerland) or nuclear (e.g. \nFrance) achieve emissions intensity lower than 45 g CO2/kWh, and countries with a \nhigh share of gas and coal can have grid emissions intensity above 700 g CO2/kWh. \nNearly 85% of the global electricity production is above this breakeven threshold (on \nan annual average basis), which means that operating an electrolyser with electricity \nfrom the grid on a continuous basis might not make sense in most countries from an \nenvironmental perspective. In addition, certifying the use of renewable electricity, and \n \n \n99 Assuming an efficiency of 55%. \n100 Assuming an efficiency of 67%. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 211  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \naccounting for the CO2 emissions associated with the electricity input, might become \nmore difficult when an electrolyser is connected to the grid, and the additional \nelectricity demand could trigger additional fossil-based generation.101 Today, off-grid \nconfigurations are common among proposed projects, which makes the GHG \nemissions accounting much simpler. At the same time, due to their fast response \ntime, electrolysers can provide increased short-term flexibility to the grid, enabling the \nintegration of renewables as well as seasonal flexibility when coupled with large-scale \nstorage. A hybrid configuration could potentially combine the best of both options, \nusing a small share of electricity from the grid (with GHG emissions tracking) to \nprovide firm capacity and increase utilisation of the assets, while limiting the GHG \nincrease. \nEmissions from construction and manufacturing of all assets (commonly called \nembedded or CAPEX emissions) are excluded from the boundaries defined by the \nISO Technical Specification to determine the GHG emissions intensity of hydrogen, \nbut should be reported for information purposes. For renewables only, they could \nrange from 0.4-2.7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2.102 These emissions are expected to decrease \nas technology innovation increases efficiency and capacity factors and decreases \nmaterial intensity, at the same time as the energy used during manufacturing is \ndecarbonised. \nNuclear electricity can be another energy source for electrolytic hydrogen production. \nAlthough direct emissions from a nuclear power plant are zero, the nuclear fuel cycle \nof uranium mining, conversion, enrichment and fuel fabrication results in emissions \nof 2.4-6.8 g CO2-eq/kWh. On this basis, the emissions intensity of hydrogen \nproduction from nuclear electricity is in the range of 0.1-0.3 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. \nFor hydrogen production from bioenergy, the direct emissions are also considered to \nbe zero. Emissions can, however, occur upstream in the bioenergy supply chains, \nand the carbon footprint depends heavily on the origin of the feedstock and the \nprocessing steps. In the case of using wood chips, these emissions may be \n4-18 kg CO2-eq/GJ103, resulting in total emissions of 1.0-4.7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for \nhydrogen from biomass gasification. Combining such a gasification plant with CCS \nand a capture rate of 95% can result in negative emissions of -16 \nto -21 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, by effectively removing biogenic carbon from the natural \ncarbon cycle.104 \n \n \n \n101 This is on top of the additional costs for the grid connection and potential delay this can introduce to the project. \n102 Embedded emissions are 17-53 g CO2-eq/kWh for solar PV and 8-18 g CO2-eq/kWh for onshore wind. For SMR, research \nand project data indicate embedded emissions are in the order of 0.4% of unabated emissions. \n103 GHG emissions from bioenergy supply can vary widely depending on the scope (land use change), type and processing steps. \n104 Hydrogen could be produced along with other co-products and negative emissions should be allocated as per ISO standards \nto avoid double counting. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

Upstream and midstream emissions include CO2 \nand methane emissions occurring during the extraction, processing, and supply of fuels (coal, natural gas) or production, \nprocessing, and transport of biomass. Error bars for natural gas and coal represent the impact of the observed range of \nemissions intensities. For natural gas, the lower bound corresponds to best available technology today (4.5 kg CO2-eq/GJ), and \nthe upper bound to the 95% percentile of the world range (18.8 kg CO2-eq/GJ). For coal, the lower bound corresponds to the \n5% percentile (6 kg CO2-eq/GJ) and the upper bound to the 95% percentile (23 kg CO2-eq/GJ) of global upstream and \nmidstream emissions of coal supply. Methane emissions are converted to CO2-eq with a GWP over a time horizon of \n100 years. The 2023 world grid average is based on a generation-weighted global average of the grid electricity intensity, with \nthe error bars representing the 10% percentile (46 g CO2-eq/kWh) and 90% percentile (702 g CO2-eq/kWh) across countries. \nThe grid electricity intensities include direct CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions at the power plants, but not \nupstream and midstream emissions for the fuels used in the power plants. Dashed lines refer to the embedded emissions \noccurring during the production of onshore wind turbines (12 g CO2-eq/kWh) and solar PV systems (33 g CO2-eq/kWh). These \nembedded emissions are not included in the ISO TS methodology, but are part of the mandatory information to report. \nElectrolysis refers to low-temperature water electrolysis with an assumed efficiency of 67% (Lower heating value [LHV]). \nHydrogen production from natural gas via SMR is based on 44.5 kWh/kg H2 for natural gas in the case of no CO2 capture, on \n45.0 kWh/kg H2 for natural gas in the case of 60% capture rate, and on 49 kWh/kg H2 for natural gas and 0.8 kWh/kg H2 for \nelectricity in the case of a 93% capture rate. Hydrogen production from natural gas via POx is based on demands of \n41 kWh/kg H2 for natural gas and 0.7 kWh/kg H2 for electricity in the case of a 99% capture rate. Hydrogen production from coal \nis based on gasification, with demands for coal of 57 kWh/kg H2 and for electricity of 0.6 kWh/kg H2 in the case of no CO2 \ncapture, demands for coal of 59 kWh/kg H2 for a CO2 capture rate of 93% and demands for coal of 60 kWh/kg H2 for a CO2 \ncapture rate of 98%. Emissions from electricity demand for CO2 transport and storage are included. \nDirect emissions represent the largest share of total emissions for hydrogen production from \nnatural gas and coal, while indirect emissions are the most relevant for electrolysis. \n- 25\n- 20\n- 15\n- 10\n- 5\n0\n 5\n 10\n 15\n 20\n 25\n 30\n 35\n 40\nBiomass w CCS\nBiomass w/o CCS\nSolar PV\nOnshore wind\nNuclear power\n2030 STEPS\n2023 global grid\nBAT upstr. emis.\nMedian upstr. emis.\nBAT upstr. emis.\nMedian upstr. emis.\nBAT upstr. emis.\nMedian upstr. emis.\nBAT upstr. emis.\nMedian upstr. emis.\nBAT upstr. emis.\nMedian upstr. emis.\nBAT upstr. emis.\nMedian upstr. emis.\nBAT upstr. emis.\nMedian upstr. emis.\nBAT upstr. emis.\nMedian upstr. emis.\nPOx w\nCCS\n99%\nATR w\nCCS\n98%\nSMR w\nCCS\n93%\nSMR w\nCCS\n60%\nSMR\nw/o\nCCS\nw CCS\n98%\nw CCS\n93%\nw/o\nCCS\nElectrolysis\nNatural gas\nCoal gasification\nkg CO₂-eq/kg H₂\nUpstream and midstream emissions - methane\nUpstream and midstream emissions - CO₂\nDirect emissions\nEmbedded emissions\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

CC BY 4.0. \nBox 7.1 \nPotential impact of hydrogen leakage \nHydrogen is an indirect greenhouse gas and its release into the atmosphere (e.g. \ndue to leakage in production, transport and use processes) can lead to climate \nimpacts. There are two main uncertainties regarding hydrogen leakage: the leakage \nrate at different steps of the supply chain, and the GWP of hydrogen once it has \nbeen released to the atmosphere. \nThe main challenge relating to the leakage rate is that most of the data available is \nfrom modelling, rather than field data obtained for existing operating assets, and is \nlargely focused on production. Filling this knowledge gap would require field data or \nexperimental data with actual hydrogen leakage measured along the entire supply \nchain. The main approach used for modelling is to take leakage rates from natural \ngas and adjust to hydrogen according to the difference in physical properties. Some \nof the limited experimental analysis indicates that hydrogen leaks at similar rates to \nnatural gas. Leakage rates* will also depend on the operational practices of the \nequipment (e.g. venting, purging, boil-off). \nReported potential sources of hydrogen leakage across the supply chain \nNote: FC = Fuel cell. \nSource: Esquivel-Elizondo, S., et al.

GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 214  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nHydrogen has an average atmospheric lifetime of 2 (1.4-2.5) years, which means its \nequivalence over time needs to be calculated to compare it with other GHG and \ncalculate its GWP. Hydrogen does not cause global warming by itself, but has an \nindirect effect through three mechanisms: \n \nHydrogen reacts with hydroxyl radicals, which are the main way methane is \ndecomposed in the atmosphere. This increases the lifetime of methane. \n \nHydrogen radicals in the troposphere react with oxygen, thereby producing more \nozone (which has a warming effect). \n \nHydrogen increases water vapour in the stratosphere (which has a warming \neffect).  \nThere is a fourth mechanism affecting the formation of (sulphate) aerosols, but this \nis relatively weak compared to the others.

This is equivalent to less than 6% of the GHG emissions from gas \nsupply in 2022. \nThere are efforts underway and planned in the areas of sensor development \n(improving precision and response time) in the Netherlands, Norway, the \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

The US DoE allocated USD 8.6 million in \nFY2023 to six projects developing and validating sensor technologies for hydrogen \nlosses. \nMore research is needed to better understand both key uncertainties and assess the \nmost cost-effective ways to deal with hydrogen leakage. Furthermore, standards and \nregulations are needed to manage the reduction of hydrogen leakage and promote \ntransparency and accountability. \n*Studies assessing the range of leakage rates by part of the supply chain include CGEP (2022), Cooper et al \n(2022), Esquivel-Elizondo et al (2023), Frazer-Nash Consultancy (2022), Joint Research Centre (2022), \nLakshmanan and Bhati (2024), and Ocko and Hamburg (2022). \n \nEmissions intensities of ammonia production \nroutes \nAmmonia production represents about a third of hydrogen demand today. Global \nproduction was nearly 180 Mt in 2022, with associated CO2 emissions of \n420 Mt CO2.105 Today, about 70% of global ammonia production is from natural gas \nwith the majority of the remainder being from coal (mainly in China). Direct emissions \nrepresent more than 80% of the total emissions. Differences in emissions in different \nregions result from differences in emissions intensity of the upstream and midstream \nproduction and in technology performance (efficiency), with a 25-35% difference \nbetween the best and worst performers. Ammonia (NH3) is produced by combining \nhydrogen with nitrogen from air, and the bulk of emissions are associated with \nhydrogen production. Since ammonia is a carbon-free molecule, almost all of the \ninput carbon can be captured during the production process, and today about 60% of \nthe CO2 emissions are typically captured in ammonia plants. Almost none of the \ncaptured CO2 is permanently stored at present, and about 130 Mt CO2 of the \ncaptured CO2 emissions are then used for urea, and are re-emitted when fertiliser is \napplied to soils. \nAmmonia production from natural gas has a global average emissions intensity of \n2.1 kg CO2-eq/kg NH3, while use of the best available technology can reduce \nemissions to 1.9 kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 (Figure 7.4). The alternatives to reduce emissions \nare the same as those discussed for hydrogen regarding the upstream emissions, \nwith the advantage that carbon capture is already part of the process. The capture \nrate could be increased by targeting the flue gas of the steam boilers, which are the \n \n \n105 This includes direct emissions and CO2 used downstream for urea production but excludes upstream and midstream \nemissions for fossil fuel supply. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

There are also indirect emissions from electricity used in parts of the \nprocess, which should also be taken into consideration. \nCoal gasification with CCS is another production route for ammonia. The emissions \nintensity of ammonia production from coal with CCS is in the range of \n0.5-2.0 kg CO2-eq/kg NH3 (again, depending on the upstream and midstream \nemissions for coal and electricity supply and the type of coal). \nCO2 emissions associated with the electricity supply govern overall emissions for the \nelectrolytic production pathway. If electricity with global average emissions intensity \nis used, specific emissions would be almost three times those of production with \nunabated gas. \nFigure 7.4 \nComparison of the emissions intensities of different ammonia production \nroutes, 2022 \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: CCS = carbon capture and storage. Ammonia production from coal is based on coal gasification, while the natural gas \nroute uses steam methane reforming (SMR). Coal with partial capture corresponds to a CO2 capture rate of 52%, while full \ncapture results in a 93% capture rate. For natural gas, partial capture corresponds to a 75% capture rate, which is an average \nof the partial capture in an SMR and an autothermal reformer, and full capture to 94%. Error bars reflect the range of upstream \nand midstream emissions for natural gas, coal and biomass supply. The 2023 world grid average is based on a generation-\nweighted global average of the grid electricity intensity resulting in 460 g CO2-eq/kWh. Dashed lines refer to the embedded \nemissions occurring during the production of onshore wind turbines (12 g CO2-eq/kWh) and solar PV systems \n(33 g CO2-eq/kWh). These embedded emissions are not included in the ISO TS methodology but are part of the mandatory \nreporting. Electrolysis refers to low-temperature water electrolysis with an assumed efficiency of 67% (LHV). \nEmissions from ammonia production from natural gas can be reduced by nearly 70% by using \ncarbon capture with a 94% capture rate. \nEmissions intensities of (re)conversion and \nshipping of hydrogen carriers \nAs a gas, hydrogen has a low volumetric energy density, and needs to be converted \nto a form with a higher energy density for transportation over long distances to be \neconomically viable.

The \ncarriers that are most commonly considered to enable hydrogen transport over long \ndistances are ammonia, liquefied hydrogen and LOHC. These are also the carriers \nincluded in the ISO Technical Specification to date. Other hydrogen carriers that may \nbecome available in the coming years include sodium/potassium borohydride and \niron oxide powder. Gas pipelines can also be used for transporting hydrogen over \nlong distances, with emissions mainly dependent on the emissions intensity of the \nelectricity used for compression. \nFigure 7.5 \nHydrogen shipping value chain and design choices affecting GHG emissions \n  \nThere are four key design choices to be made across different steps in the value chain for \nshipping hydrogen, and these define the GHG emissions at each step in the process.  \nAmmonia \nThe GHG emissions associated with use of ammonia as a hydrogen carrier are \ndetermined by different factors across the supply chain (see Figure 7.6). Different \ncases shown in Table 7.1 demonstrate that individual parameters can change the \nlifecycle emissions. \nThe dominant factor in the GHG emissions of ammonia production is the electricity \ninput to the electrolyser. These emissions are directly proportional to the share of \nelectricity that comes from the grid and the emissions intensity of the grid. Meeting \nonly 5% of the electricity input from a grid with an average emissions intensity of \n100 g CO2/kWh would lead to total specific emissions intensity of almost \n0.4 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. Every conversion step leads to energy losses, which means the \nenergy efficiency of the supply chain is just about 35%. Therefore, any emissions \nassociated with electricity consumption will be increased by a factor of three when \nexpressed in terms of the final hydrogen delivered. These emissions alone would be \nalmost equivalent to the lowest threshold in the production tax credit (45V) in the \nUnited States (0.45 kg CO2-eq/kg H2). This introduces a trade-off between economic \nand environmental considerations. From the economic perspective, a small share of \nelectricity from the grid can provide a source of firm electricity and reduce the need \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

CC BY 4.0. \nEfficiency losses along the supply chain can make embedded emissions in this \npathway larger than all the emissions from onsite hydrogen production. These are \nincluded in the ISO Technical Specification for information purposes only, but are \nsignificant (1.3-2.0 kg CO2-eq/kg H2). Besides the electrolyser, the electricity source \nused for the auxiliary equipment also makes a big difference. A compressor is needed \nto go from the operating pressure of the electrolyser (1-40 bar) to the operating \npressure of the ammonia synthesis (150-250 bar), requiring 0.9-3.8 kWh/kg H2. \nAdditionally, the air separation unit consumes another 0.5-2.2 kWh/kg H2. This is an \norder of magnitude lower than the 50-55 kWh/kg H2 consumed by electrolysis, but it \ncould result in much higher emissions, given that the compressors are not as flexible \nas the electrolyser and require closer to 24/7 supply. If the compressors operate only \nwith electricity from the grid, the resulting emissions are 0.4 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for \nevery 100 g CO2-eq/kWh increase in the emissions intensity of the grid. \nIn contrast, the emissions intensity of the grid on the importer’s side has a much lower \ninfluence \non \nthe \nlifecycle \nemissions. \nAmmonia \ncracking \nis \nfavoured \nthermodynamically at low pressures and hydrogen needs compression before use. \nThis results in an additional energy consumption of at least 2 kWh/kg H2 for \ncompressing the hydrogen from 1 bar to 30 bar (at the lower end of typical pressures \nused for transport by pipeline) and almost 5 kWh/kg H2 for compression to 700 bar \n(at the higher end of road transport applications).  \nUsing heavy fuel oil (HFO) as a shipping fuel would result in a specific emissions \nincrease of 0.8 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 (for 10 000 km), leading to a net increase of 13% in \nthe specific emissions, despite improving the pathway efficiency by 1.5% points (to \n38%). Similarly, the use of natural gas for cracking increases the pathway efficiency \nby 7% points (to 43%) but increases the specific emissions by 2.8 kg CO2-eq/kg H2. \nTherefore, in both cases, the use of the hydrogen and ammonia transported to \nprovide the energy requirements of different steps of the supply chain leads to lower \nspecific CO2 emissions, despite the lower supply chain efficiency. Cracking could also \nbe done with waste heat, but would require heat at at least 500°C. Where waste heat \nis available at this temperature, it is typically utilised locally (either for process heat \nor power generation) and would therefore need to be replaced, potentially generating \nadditional emissions. Another option is to use solar thermal (coupled with thermal \nstorage), which can achieve temperatures of more than 1 000°C and is not \nassociated with GHG emissions, but could require oversizing to compensate for a \nlower number of operating hours. In both of these cases, there would still be some \nemissions from cracking related to the electricity demand. \nLiquid organic hydrogen carriers  \nThe fundamental difference in emissions intensity for other hydrogen carriers relates to the \nform of energy used and the part of the supply chain that requires this energy (Figure 7.7). \nIn the case of LOHCs, the first step is to incorporate the hydrogen into the carrier \nmolecule,106 through a process called hydrogenation, which is exothermic and requires \nlimited electricity. Therefore, there is an energy surplus at the exporting side, which in most \ncases is assumed to have low-cost renewable energy. The hydrogen content of LOHCs is \n \n \n106 The most common molecules considered are benzene, toluene, dibenzyltoluene, benzyltoluene, but a wider range of \nmolecules could be used. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

Values are based on large-scale commercial facilities. Distance of 10 000 \nkm assumed for shipping. Values for LOHC reflect the potential use of different chemical compounds as carriers. Ammonia could \nbe directly used in some applications, which would make the reconversion step unnecessary. \nAmong hydrogen carriers, ammonia and LOHC require the most energy as heat on the \nimporting side, for reconversion, and liquefied hydrogen is the most energy-efficient pathway. \nFrom a GHG emissions standpoint, the choices to be made about design of the \nsupply chain are similar to those for ammonia. Emissions are lower if the transported \n \n \n107 Fuel consumption is proportional to the engine size (power), which is turn proportional to the vessel size in tonnage. In a liquid \nhydrogen carrier, 100% of the shipping fuel is used to transport the hydrogen, while in an LOHC carrier, only 6-7% is used for \nthis (the other 93-94% is used to transport the carrier). Furthermore, with LOHC, the carrier needs to be transported back to the \norigin, resulting in additional fuel consumption in comparison to ammonia or liquid hydrogen, which are typically offloaded at the \nimport terminal. \n0\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n 10\n 12\n 14\nAmmonia\nLOHC\nLH2\nAmmonia\nLOHC\nLH2\nLH2\nConversion\nShipping\nReconversion\nSpecific energy consumption \n(kWh/kgH2)\nFuel\nHeat\nElectricity\nAmmonia\nLOHC\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nAmmonia\nLOHC\nLH₂\nEnergy efficiency\nElectrolysis\nConversion\nShipping\nReconversion\nEnergy delivered\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

CC BY 4.0. \nhydrogen is used as a shipping fuel (through onboard dehydrogenation), and as fuel \nto supply the heat for dehydrogenation at the importing terminal, than if HFO or \nnatural gas are used (Figure 7.8). The GHG emissions for LOHC would be \n0.2 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 at the importing side for compression and dehydrogenation for \nevery 100 g CO2/kWh increase in the grid’s emission intensity. The rest of the \nemissions associated with the production route are dominated by the emissions from \nelectrolysis, which is not a differentiator between supply chains. In terms of both total \nemissions along the supply chain and in efficiency, ammonia results in similar values \nto LOHC, since the higher electricity consumption for compression at the exporting \nsite is compensated by lower emissions associated with hydrogen recovery from the \ncarrier at the importing site. Unlike LOHC, ammonia can be directly used in some \napplications, meaning that energy is not needed for reconversion, improving both the \nGHG emissions and the energy efficiency of the pathway. \nLiquid hydrogen \nHydrogen liquefaction requires significant energy (equivalent to 18-30% of the energy \ncontained in the hydrogen), due to its low boiling point (20 K) and associated boil-off \nlosses upon storage and transport. However, its main advantage is that this energy \nconsumption takes place at the exporting side, which is expected to have abundant \nrenewables, meaning low-cost, low-emissions energy should be available. Shipping \nliquefied hydrogen results in energy losses due to boil-off, but has a low energy \nconsumption at the import terminal since there is no demand for heat nor need for \ncompression.108 This results in higher supply chain efficiency, which can be 60% \nhigher than that of LOHC (Figure 7.7). However, the high energy consumption for \nliquefaction means that the source of electricity is critical. With an electricity demand \nof 6 kWh/kg H2109 (mainly for compressors), the emissions from liquefaction are \n0.6 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for every 100 g CO2/kWh increase in the emissions intensity of \nthe grid. This electricity could come from renewables, but this would require a stable \nsupply, as intermittent operation of a liquefaction unit has not been demonstrated. \nAlternatively, batteries could be used to smooth the electricity input, but would \nincrease costs. For shipping, the hydrogen boil-off from stored liquid hydrogen110 is \nsufficient to meet the energy demand of the ship. If more energy is needed (as in the \nreturn journey, where the boil-off might not be enough), regasification of additional \nhydrogen from onboard storage is possible with limited additional costs. In \ncomparison, use of HFO may not be an attractive option since it would increase \nemissions, energy consumption and costs (due to the need for an onboard re-\nliquefaction unit). \nWhen these factors are taken into account, the supply chain emissions from liquid \nhydrogen could be almost 40% lower than those of ammonia or LOHC for similar \n \n \n108 A liquid hydrogen pump can be used instead of a compressor which has a much lower energy consumption.  \n109 Expected to be the long-term target for liquefaction (currently at 10-12 kWh/kg H2). \n110 Boil-off rate for commercial vessels is expected to be in the order of 0.1%/day or less. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

For liquid hydrogen, HFO \nuse for shipping and NG for cracking are excluded, since shipping uses the boil-off from the storage tanks and there is no heat \ndemand associated with hydrogen regasification. \nFor LOHC, the lowest emissions come from using the hydrogen cargo as a fuel for shipping \nand for dehydrogenation, while liquid hydrogen has lower emissions overall if there are low \nCO2 emissions associated with the electricity used. \n \n \n \n \n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\nReference 100% RES-\nbased\nelectricity\nGrid\nelectricity\nfor utilities\nHFO as\nshipping\nfuel\n2x shipping\ndistance\n400 g \nCO₂/kWh \nimport grid\nNG for\ndehydr.\nSolar\nthermal for\ndehydr.\nConversion\nShipping\nReconversion\nSupply chain efficiency (%)\nSpecific emissions (kg CO₂-eq/kg H₂)\nEmbedded emissions\nCompression\nDehydrogenation\nShipping\nHydrogenation\nWater treatment\nGrid electricity\nEnergy delivered\n(right axis)\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\nReference 100% RES-\nbased\nelectricity\nGrid\nelectricity\nfor\nliquefaction\nHFO as\nshipping\nfuel\n2x shipping\ndistance\n400 g \nCO₂/kWh \nimport grid\nNG for\ncracking\nSolar\nthermal\nConversion\nShipping\nReconversion\nSupply chain efficiency (%)\nSpecific emissions (kg CO₂-eq/kg H₂)\nEmbedded emissions\nCompression\nRegasification\nShipping\nLiquefaction\nWater treatment\nGrid electricity\nEnergy delivered\n(right axis)\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

CC BY 4.0. \nEmissions intensity of carbon-containing \nhydrogen-based fuels \nHydrogen is a versatile molecule that can react with multiple compounds and can be \nused either as a fuel or as a chemical feedstock. Hydrogen can also be converted to \ncarbon-containing fuels such as methane, methanol or hydrocarbons that can be \nused directly. Given that these fuels emit CO2 upon combustion, the origin of the \ncarbon in the fuel is crucial to the overall emissions. If the carbon originates from a \nfossil source, combustion will make a net positive contribution to CO2 emissions,111 \nand the key question is how to allocate that CO2 across processes in the supply chain. \nIf the carbon has a biogenic origin or comes from direct air capture, then the fuel \ncombustion does not add to atmospheric carbon, and the key question for carbon \naccounting narrows down to the emissions associated with the conversion steps. \nFigure 7.9 \nSpecific GHG emissions for carbon-containing hydrogen derivatives as a \nfunction of CO2 emissions intensity of the electricity input \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: w/ = with; w/o = without. Excludes emissions from construction and manufacturing. Low-temperature direct air capture is \nassumed using a heat pump with a coefficient of performance of 3 using grid electricity. Compression to operating pressure of \nthe synthesis unit is included. Synthetic fuel “w/ end use CO2“ means that the CO2 is fossil-based, with CO2 from combustion \nhaving a positive contribution to emissions, while “w/o end use” means the CO2 is biogenic or from air. Fossil fuel routes include \naverage upstream and midstream emissions and emissions from combustion. \nSynthetic fuels need to be produced from electricity with very low emissions intensity in order \nto have lower emissions than their fossil counterparts. \nConversion to synthetic fuels enables the use of existing distribution infrastructure \nand end-use technologies, but reduces the supply chain efficiency. The energy \nefficiency of the synthesis step varies from 57% for synthetic kerosene112 to 77% for \nmethanation and 86% for methanol synthesis (all exothermic reactions). These \n \n \n111 This is incompatible with a net zero emissions system since fossil CO2 ends up in the atmosphere. The use of fossil CO2 can \nstill result in emissions reduction since the CO2 is used twice potentially halving emissions (in case carbon-free energy is used). \n112 Kerosene is co-produced with naphtha and diesel, but the text refers to kerosene only for simplicity.

GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 224  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nefficiency losses translate into lower final product yield, which increases the \nmagnitude of GHG emissions upstream in the value chain. \nThe two choices about supply chain design with the most influence on the GHG \nemissions of carbon-containing hydrogen derivatives are the electricity source and \nthe CO2 source. Figure 7.9 shows the influence of the emissions from the electricity \nsource. The slope is defined by the supply chain efficiency. Synthetic jet fuel is the \nleast efficient, which means every CO2 molecule emitted upon electricity production \nis multiplied by a factor of 2.5-3 when expressed in terms of the energy in the product. \nFor synthetic methanol and synthetic methane,113 while methanol has a higher \nefficiency for the synthesis step, additional energy is required for compression, since \nthe synthesis operates at higher pressure than methanation (50-150 bar vs 10-\n70 bar), resulting in a similar slope for both pathways. Considering the range of \nupstream and midstream GHG emissions from oil and gas production, synthetic jet \nfuel and methane would equal the emissions of their fossil counterparts when the \nemissions intensity of the electricity input is 95-140 g CO2-eq/kWh. Synthetic jet fuel \nand methane have a similar point of intersection, given that the lower conversion \nefficiency and higher CO2 consumption per MJ of product of jet fuel compared to \nmethane is compensated by higher emissions of the fossil fuel reference. For \nmethanol, the electricity emissions intensity required to breakeven with the fossil fuel \nreference is higher, at 160-190 g CO2-eq/kWh, due to the higher efficiency and lower \n(than Fischer-Tropsch) CO2 use. These values represent the upper bound and best \ncase for synthetic fuels. The breakeven points would be lower if the CO2 source were \nfossil-based with full allocation to the synthetic fuel. In this case, the CO2 emitted \nupon combustion would be the same for both fossil and synthetic routes. As such, for \nthe synthetic fuels to have lower emissions than fossil fuels, the emissions associated \nwith the CO2 capture, compression and water treatment of electrolysis would need to \nbe lower than the upstream emissions from oil and gas. This would shift the \nbreakeven points to 5-50 g CO2-eq/kWh for methane and jet fuel, and \n40-70 g CO2-eq/kWh in the case of methanol. The effect on emissions of other design \nchoices, such as the technology used to supply the heat for carbon capture, will be \ndependent on the temperature level and heat demand. Heat demand can be nearly \nzero for processes with concentrated CO2 streams, such as ethanol or ethylene \noxide, going up to 5.3-7.2 GJ/t CO2 for direct air capture. \nAlternatives for the carbon accounting of the CO2 source \nThere are two related, but different, key questions for CO2 emissions accounting. The \nfirst relates to the process of sourcing the CO2, and how the emissions from that \nprocess are allocated to the CO2 stream that is used for the synthetic fuel alongside \nother products (e.g. electricity) from the same facility. In addition, given that the \nhydrogen-based fuel is combusted, and the CO2 is released to the atmosphere, the \n \n \n113 Synthetic fuels are also known as e-fuels and include methane, methanol and kerosene (jet fuel), and are a subset of hydrogen \nderivatives (which also include use as feedstock). \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 225  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nsecond key question concerns how those emissions are allocated among the \nstakeholders of the value chain. This section explains both aspects and suggests \nsome alternative options to deal with them. \nAllocation of emissions associated with the CO2 source \nThe key factors that define GHG emissions accounting for synthetic fuels are the \nboundaries of the system and the methodological approach used. With regards to \nboundaries, the options are gate-to-gate (excluding both raw material processing and \ndownstream fuel use), cradle-to-gate (which expands the scope to the raw materials), \nand cradle-to-grave (which expands the scope to the product use as well). The \nsuggested scope for carbon capture and use applications is cradle-to-grave, but a \nsmaller scope (cradle-to-gate) might be justified in cases where the downstream \nemissions, technical performance, and end-of-life are identical and the purpose of \naccounting is to compare different routes.114 In practical terms, this means that on the \nsupply side of synthetic fuels, the CO2 used should not be considered as having \nnegative emissions (under the assumption that it is being consumed in the process). \nInstead, it should be treated in the same way as any other process feedstock, with \nthe emissions associated with its production accounted for in the stream. This is \nespecially important when the CO2 source is from fossil origin, resulting in net positive \nCO2 emissions. Even for biogenic CO2 sources, the CO2 used should be counted \nexplicitly at each stage of the life cycle since, for example, in methanation or synthetic \nkerosene, part of the CO2 input might end up being released as fugitive methane, \nwhich has a higher GWP than CO2. This may be overlooked if it is assumed that the \nCO2 input is equal to the amount that will be emitted later. \nThe CO2 source will, in most cases, have been produced as a result of processes \nthat have multiple useful products.115 For example, cement plants with CO2 capture \nemit CO2 along with the cement (Figure 7.10). This raises the question of how to \nallocate the CO2 emissions of the cement plant across its different products (cement, \ncaptured CO2, electricity), with methodological approaches typically using one of two \nfundamental options: \n \nAttributional methodology: Quantifies the environmental impacts of a product or \nservice over its lifecycle as a part of a current system. Total CO2 emissions from a \nprocess are allocated among the products in proportion to their energy content, mass \nor economic value. \n \nConsequential methodology: Quantifies the environmental impacts of a change in \nthe system. It includes indirect effects and considers the consequences beyond the \nsystem under study. \nThe suggested approach from an LCA perspective is to use a consequential \napproach and expand the boundaries of the system analysed to include the upstream \n \n \n114 This does not mean that the fuel production is considered as CO2 storage, but it means that the end use phase is out of \nscope since it does not make a difference when comparing pathways. \n115 Direct air capture is the only exception where CO2 is the only product. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 226  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nCO2 production. This solves the problem of allocation method among products since \nnow all the products are included in the functional unit.116 Other minor by-products \nthat are not part of the functional unit can still be considered by using the \nenvironmental burden avoided from their counterfactual production (i.e. substitution). \nExpanding the boundaries of the system solves the challenge of accounting for \nproducts that have multiple functions, but it may be more difficult to implement in \nregulation, given that it cuts across processes. The ISO Technical Specification for \nhydrogen provides guidance in this respect and suggest a hierarchy of steps to follow. \nFigure 7.10 Alternative boundary definitions used to account for GHG emissions from \nmethanol using CO2 sourced from a cement plant \n \nNotes: Some steps are omitted in the figure for simplicity, including methane production and processing, CO2 transport and \nwater treatment for electrolysis, but should be part of the emissions embedded to the various streams.

Values consider avoided burden from co-products assuming heat from a natural gas boiler with 90% efficiency is \ndisplaced and specific emissions from oxygen production of 240 g CO2 per kg of oxygen. Electricity from the grid (for methanol \nsynthesis) assumes a grid emissions intensity of 250 g CO2-eq/kWh. \n \nUsing the approach of system expansion to cover a new functional unit and avoided \nburden (as shown in the last row of Table 7.2) provides more room for different \nresults. For example, the electricity could be assumed to displace the average \nelectricity mix in the grid on an annual basis, for a specific period, or from a specific \npower generation technology. The definition of the functional unit is also key. For \nexample, if the functional unit changes to one unit of electricity, a CO2 benefit could \nbe taken for the avoided burden for the methanol production (presumably from natural \ngas without capture). This highlights the importance of the design of the regulation \nand the need for harmonisation across countries to ensure differences in these \nmethodological choices do not become a barrier for trade. \nThe choice of the approach used is not only a matter of methodology, and could also \nbe influenced by national regulation. For example, the EU Emissions Trading System \n(ETS) does not favour CO2 use, and considers the CO2 to have been emitted when it \nis used (e.g. for synthetic fuels). A review of the ETS is due in 2026, in which the \nEuropean Commission expects to assess in more detail the case where CO2 is used \nfor non-permanent products (such as carbon-based fuels). It will also assess if the \naccounting should be done at the point of emission to the atmosphere (i.e. \ndownstream accounting), or when the CO2 is initially captured (upstream accounting). \nUnder the Renewable Energy Directive, synthetic fuels with CO2 sourced from power \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 228  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nplants are only allowed until 2035,117 whereas those with biogenic CO2 or CO2 from \ndirect air capture are allowed for the entire period to 2050. Another example is from \nthe United Kingdom, where an allocation method based on energy is proposed as a \nway of allocating the emissions of processes that produce synthetic fuels and other \nco-products. \nAllocation of CO2 emissions among stakeholders in the supply \nchain \nIn the example of methanol used above (Figure 7.10), allocating the CO2 emissions \nfrom the final use of methanol in ships among stakeholders can make a big difference \nfor each stakeholder in the value chain, since other emissions are relatively small. \nThe emissions could be allocated to the process that originally produced the CO2 (in \nthe example above, the cement plant) under the logic that since CO2 is not being \nstored, then no benefit can be taken by such facility. This is the approach used, for \nexample, in the EU ETS. This would mean higher emissions for this step, since the \ncarbon capture unit consumes additional energy. The result would be an increase of \nmore than 16 times the emissions allocated to that step, in comparison to the case \nwhere all the emissions are allocated to another step in the supply chain (Figure \n7.11). \nThe emissions could also be allocated to the synthetic fuel plant, under the logic that \nif there is no certification scheme in place to differentiate between the low-emissions \nand carbon-intensive commodities, the synthetic fuel should receive the penalty for \nthe fuel that is combusted downstream. Allocating the emissions to the end use in \nthis way results in the largest difference for different stakeholders, since there are no \nother emissions produced by this process other than those from combustion. \nAllocation to this step could be justified under the “polluter pays” principle. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n117 Other ETS facilities (like cement) are allowed until 2040. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

CC BY 4.0. \nFigure 7.11 he result of alternative approaches to allocating the CO2 emissions from \nsynthetic fuel combustion \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nThere are several ways of allocating the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion among \nstakeholders in the supply chain, with significantly different results. \nThe way that emissions are allocated should also be considered in light of the \ndistribution of the price premium for producing a commodity with lower lifecycle \nemissions.118 For example, if the emissions are fully allocated to the end use, but the \nprice premium is received by the synthetic methanol producer, it would result in the \nsame emissions for the end use (as fossil fuels), but with higher operating costs. \nThere must therefore be alignment between these two parameters to ensure that the \neconomic incentives for each stakeholder in the supply chain are sufficient to \nencourage the shift to the synthetic pathway. \nIt should be noted that Figure 7.11 shows the extreme cases, and any combination \nin between is possible. The actual percentages could differ not only across regions, \nbut also over time and technology pathway. These allocation factors could be set by \npolicy makers as part of the regulatory framework for synthetic fuels (or more broadly, \nfor CO2 use) or be defined by private actors through negotiations for specific projects \nand applications. \nUsing different approaches for CO2 allocation across national regulatory frameworks, \nboth with regards to the CO2 source and the stakeholders across the value chain, can \ncreate a barrier to trade of these carbon-containing products. Producers will need to \ncomply with and certify their products against different regulatory requirements, \nincreasing the complexity of the process and the transactional costs. This highlights \n \n \n118 Assuming that the end user is willing to pay for the lower emissions associated with the commodity. This allocation does not \nrefer to the emissions from a single multi-functional process, but instead the allocation among different sequential steps of a \nsupply chain. \n0\n 10\n 20\n 30\n 40\n 50\n 60\n 70\n 80\nCement\nplant\nMethanol\nplant\nEnd use\nCement\nplant\nMethanol\nplant\nEnd use\nCement\nplant\nMethanol\nplant\nEnd use\n100% allocation to cement\n100% allocation to methanol\n100% allocation to end use\nCO₂ emissions (g CO₂-eq/MJ)\nCO₂ captured\nDirect emissions\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7.

CC BY 4.0. \nthe importance of international co-operation on the matter, in the same way as is \ncurrently happening for the certification of hydrogen (see Chapter 6. Policies).  \nEffect of temporal correlation on GHG \nemissions \nMany countries are now defining additional criteria for hydrogen to be classified as \nrenewable, clean or low-carbon and for project developers to apply for funding \nschemes or other types of policy support. These are most critical for the electrolytic \npathway, where most of the emissions are upstream. The most common rules relate \nto the additional character of the renewable electricity, and the geographical and \ntemporal correlation of hydrogen production and renewable electricity. All these \nconsiderations aim to ensure that when the electrolyser uses renewable electricity it \ndoes not result in higher emissions from the grid by triggering additional fossil \ngeneration. \nPolicies relating to temporal correlation will need to factor in certain trade-offs. The \nstrictest framework is hourly correlation, which aims to support the use of renewable \nelectricity and emissions reduction. However, this could lead to a cost premium, either \ndue to the need for batteries to ensure a steady supply of electricity, or as a result of \nlower utilisation of the electrolyser. At the other extreme, annual correlation leads to \na lower production cost, but it means, for example, that electricity from solar PV in \nsummer can be claimed to power the electrolyser during a night in winter, a period in \nwhich the actual electricity going into the electrolyser could be from fossil generation. \nCountries have so far adopted a gradual approach to temporal correlation. In the \nEuropean Union, monthly correlation is allowed until 2030, with hourly correlation \nafterwards.119 In the United States, the draft 45V guidance proposes annual \ncorrelation until 2027 and hourly afterwards. In the United Kingdom, 30-minute \ncorrelation is used to determine the nature of the electricity consumed in the \nelectrolyser. Australia requires annual rather than hourly correlation (and does not \nhave requirements for additionality), in order for production to be eligible for a tax \nincentive, noting that compliance will increase operating costs for projects. Similarly, \nthe production-linked incentives from India do not need to comply with any temporal \ncorrelation (or additionality) conditions. \nA Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) can be a way to procure renewable electricity \nwhen connected to the grid. These can take the form of a physical PPA, where the \nelectricity producer and the electrolyser are in the same bidding area, or a financial \nPPA, where there is no need for a physical connection. Regulation might prevent the \nuse of financial PPAs, or mandate PPAs as a requirement to ensure that electrolysers \nuse renewable electricity. For example, a PPA is not needed in the European Union \n \n \n119 Hourly correlation is not needed for areas with more than 90% renewables over the previous calendar year and when the \nproject integrates renewables, and it is reducing curtailment. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 231  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nwhen the electrolyser is integrating electricity that would have otherwise been \ncurtailed, or when the bidding zone had more than 90% renewable electricity in the \nprevious calendar year, but is required in all other cases. \nFigure 7.12 shows the effect that temporal correlation could have on the CO2 emissions \nfrom hydrogen production for a sample location in Chile, using the hourly average grid \nemissions from 2023. In this example, electricity from fossil generation accounts for \nalmost 45%, hydropower and biofuels close to 30%, and the remainder from wind and \nsolar PV. With annual correlation, the renewable assets can be oversized, injecting \nelectricity to the grid and compensating for the grid electricity used in periods of low \nrenewable generation. As the temporal correlation becomes stricter, the specific \nemissions fall, since it narrows down the options to shift around the renewable \nelectricity (e.g. weekly correlation would not allow for solar PV generation in summer \nto be used in winter, which is possible under an annual correlation). \nBatteries enable lower emissions for two reasons. First, they allow electricity to be stored \nwhen renewable generation is the highest, and when the emissions in the grid are the \nlowest, in order to then be used during times when renewable generation is lower and \nCO2 emissions are higher. This then allows hydrogen to be produced during hours when \nrenewable generation is low, when the emissions intensity of the grid is higher, and the \nCO2 penalty for using grid electricity for the electrolyser would the highest.  \nFigure 7.12 CO2 emissions intensity of hydrogen production with a variable time horizon \nfor temporal correlation, Chile \n \nIEA.

CC BY 4.0. \nThe specific additional CO2 emissions for a less strict temporal correlation will vary \ndepending on the specific electricity mix, the quality of the renewable resources and \ncapacity ratios between the assets. However, additional criteria beyond scope and \nmethodology are also important, given that depending on the accounting rules used, \nthe hydrogen produced by the same assets could appear to have different emissions \n(Figure 7.12).  \nPrevious research120 has mixed conclusions depending on the assumptions and \nboundary conditions. The specific effect of the temporal correlation on production and \nsystem cost, as well as facility-level and system emissions will depend on the specific \nelectricity system and market design. Some of the most influential factors are: \n \nThe flexibility of the hydrogen demand to follow renewable production profiles, or \nalternatively, the availability and cost of hydrogen storage capacities. \n \nThe presence of other flexibility alternatives for the power system (e.g. \ninterconnection, batteries, demand response), which will affect how critical \nelectrolysers are as a source of flexibility. \n \nCost factors, such as carbon and fuel prices on the supply side, and the willingness \nto pay for the renewable hydrogen on the demand side, since these will affect both \nthe electricity mix and the electricity price point at which running the electrolysers is \neconomically attractive. \nWith these factors in mind, there are several choices to made when designing policies \nrelating to temporal correlation: \n \nThe use of marginal or average emissions when considering the electricity used from \nthe grid and the default emissions factors for GHG calculation. \n \nHow the temporal correlation is implemented. So far, schemes have opted for the \nbalancing to be done on a net energy basis.121 Another option is to use a carbon \nbasis, and ensure that all the CO2 produced by the electricity withdrawn from the grid \nis fully compensated (within the temporal horizon defined), regardless of the net \nelectricity balance. \n \nAny additional conditions, including exemptions, with a view to market development. \nThere is a trade-off between increasing complexity, which might make compliance \n(and, therefore, project development) more difficult, and the benefit of covering a \nbroader range of cases and ensuring the use of renewable energy and – more \nimportantly – decreasing emissions. Additional conditions can include renewable \nenergy shares, emissions intensity thresholds, electricity prices, or full-load operating \nhours of the electrolyser. \n \nIn addition, as the power system is increasingly decarbonised, the electricity grid and \nits emissions will change. Given the difference between the timeline for grid \n \n \n120 See for example: Brauer et. al (2022), Deloitte (2024), Frontier Economics (2021a), Frontier Economics (2021b), Giovanniello \net al (2024), Ricks et al (2023), Ruhnau and Schiele (2023), Schlund and Theile (2022). \n121 Every MWh taken from the grid has to be replaced with a MWh of renewable electricity at another point in time within the \nwindow of the temporal correlation defined. This might lead to the case where the net emissions are positive despite the net zero \nbalance of energy. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives \nPAGE | 233  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \ndecarbonisation (5-10 years) and the typical time horizon for projects (25+ years), \nany policy should provide clarity on the evolution of these parameters over time. This \nwill also provide greater clarity for investors. \nThis long list of considerations for policy design shows the importance of \nharmonisation of accounting methods and criteria. This is not only critical for national \nemission inventories, and to avoid double counting,122 but also for the private sector, \nto reduce the administrative burden associated with having to navigate multiple \nschemes with different rules, and ultimately facilitating project investment and \nexecution.\n \n \n122 This is relevant when hydrogen is traded across jurisdictions. For example, the exporting country might use an hourly emission \nintensity based on actual electricity mix, while an importing country might use an average annual value for the previous year. The \nemissions accounted in each national inventory will not match and there could either be double counting or some emissions that \nare not accounted for. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 234  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nHighlights \n \nLatin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is well-placed to produce low-emissions \nhydrogen and its derivatives, building on its abundant natural and renewable \nenergy resources and largely decarbonised electricity mix (of which 60% comes \nfrom renewables). In 2023, hydrogen demand in the region reached 4 Mt, mostly \nfor use in oil refining and chemicals manufacturing. Almost 90% is produced using \nnatural gas, which contributes to the region’s reliance on imports.  \n \nToday, 80% of nitrogen-based fertiliser demand is met by imports, with a trade \ndeficit equivalent to up to 0.4% of GDP. Domestic low-emissions ammonia \nproduction could reduce this deficit and improve price stability. LAC holds one-fifth \nof the world’s iron ore reserves, with high-grade ores suitable for hydrogen-based \ndirect reduced iron (H2-DRI). In some world regions, importing hot briquetted iron \nfrom LAC instead of iron ore could cut the cost of reduced iron by almost a third. \n \nOpportunities differ by country. Mexico and Colombia, for example, could leverage \nlarge existing hydrogen demand from refineries. Chile’s mining sector could use \nlow-emissions hydrogen to decarbonise operations, such as for the production of \nammonium nitrate for industrial explosives and for heavy machinery. Brazil \naccounts for 90% of iron ore trade from LAC and is therefore uniquely positioned \nto develop H2-DRI for steelmaking. The country’s biogenic CO2 resources are \nmore than sufficient to meet domestic needs for synthetic fuels and urea, opening \nup export potential. Panama could become a hub for low-emissions shipping fuels \nand is already targeting 5% of bunkering from hydrogen derivatives by 2030. \n \nDeployment is still nascent. Based on announced projects, LAC could produce \nover 7 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen by 2030, but only about 0.1% of these \nprojects is in operation, under construction or has reached a final investment \ndecision (FID). The high cost of capital in the region remains a barrier, and could \nundermine the competitive production costs from its strong renewable resources. \nIn addition, a massive expansion of renewable capacity would be needed – if all \nhydrogen projects in the pipeline come to fruition, wind and solar PV generation \nwould need to increase by 140% within this decade for hydrogen production alone. \n \nAction is required in the short term to unlock LAC’s potential, balancing domestic \ndemand with export ambitions. Demand creation measures can help close the cost \ngap, improve energy security by reducing imports of natural gas and ammonia, \nand create higher value-added export opportunities. Hydrogen hubs can drive \neconomies of scale and integrate supply chains while accelerating learning. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 235  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nUnlocking the potential of low-emissions \nhydrogen in Latin America and the Caribbean \nIn November 2023, the IEA published an in-depth and comprehensive assessment \nof Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the Latin America Energy Outlook. With \nabundant fossil fuels, renewable energy resources and critical minerals, LAC is well \npositioned to thrive in the global clean energy transition. The Outlook explores the \nopportunities and challenges the region faces in meeting its energy and climate goals, \nwhile highlighting its opportunities in the global energy system, including for low-\nemissions hydrogen. Building on these findings, this edition of the Global Hydrogen \nReview updates and expands the discussion on the potential role of low-emissions \nhydrogen production and demand, as well as export opportunities as LAC advances \ntowards its energy and climate goals. \nAs we show in this chapter, low-emissions hydrogen represents a significant \nopportunity for LAC to meet its climate targets while generating economic growth for \nthe region. Fully realising this potential will hinge on the timely implementation of \nsupportive policies and strategies. Several governments in the region have already \nlaid out their hydrogen strategies, and some have even begun the implementation \nprocess. However, many of these plans were developed at a time when there were \nhigh expectations for rapid deployment and cost reductions, despite the uncertainties \nsurrounding hydrogen. It was anticipated that low-emissions hydrogen would scale \nup quickly, catalysing the development of a global hydrogen market, and the plans \nare therefore strongly focused on exports. \nWhile the sector has made notable progress in recent years, as this report shows, \nthe pace of development has fallen short of initial expectations. This discrepancy \nhighlights a need to recalibrate the aspirational targets and priorities set out in \nnational hydrogen strategies, and to adopt a balanced approach between domestic \nopportunities and export ambitions. Countries in the region can still adjust their plans, \nespecially as many of the measures outlined in the strategies have yet to be \ntranslated into concrete policies. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \n \n \n \nChapter 8.

In 2023, LAC accounted for 10% \nof world oil production, 5% of natural gas and 1% of coal. While the region is now \na net exporter of oil and coal, it is a net importer of natural gas. Globally, natural \ngas production has increased by 30% since 2010, but production in LAC has fallen \nby 2%. Regional demand for natural gas increased by 14% over the same period, \nresulting in a persistent trade deficit in natural gas. \nLAC generates about 6% of the world's electricity, more than 60% of which comes \nfrom renewable sources,123 double the global average of 30%. While the region's \nshare of wind, solar PV and geothermal energy is similar to the global average, its \nshare of hydropower is far higher, accounting for more than 40% of electricity \ngeneration, compared to about 15% globally. Over the past 15 years, hydropower \ngeneration in LAC has remained stable, but its contribution to the overall electricity \nmix has fallen from over 50% in 2010 due to the overall increase in electricity \ngeneration. Despite this, the total share of renewables has increased, driven by \nsignificant growth in solar PV and wind generation, particularly in the last 5 years. \nHydrogen production and demand  \nIn LAC, demand for hydrogen reached about 4 Mt in 2023, approximately 4% of \nthe global total of 97 Mt. The majority of demand occurs in the five largest \neconomies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, as well as Trinidad \nand Tobago (Figure 8.2). The latter is the leading hydrogen consumer in LAC due \nto its chemical industry, which uses hydrogen to produce large volumes of \nammonia and methanol for export. In most other LAC countries, oil refineries are \nthe primary consumers of hydrogen. Over the past decade, a decline in oil refining \nhas reduced total demand for hydrogen across the region, as have recent \ndifficulties in securing natural gas at competitive prices for ammonia production, \nwhich in 2019 led to the complete shutdown of ammonia production in Mexico and \nthe closure of the only remaining plant in Brazil. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n123 Renewables includes geothermal, hydropower, marine, modern bioenergy and renewable waste, solar and wind. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

CC BY 4.0. \nNote: LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean.  \nHydrogen demand reached 4 Mt in LAC in 2023, about 4% of the global total, mostly for oil \nrefining or – especially in Trinidad and Tobago – for chemicals manufacturing. \nToday, hydrogen production in LAC consumes approximately 1.5% of the region’s \ntotal energy supply and accounts for 2% of the total final energy consumption.124 \nAlmost 90% of this hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of natural gas, \nresulting in annual emissions of more than 30 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent \n(Mt CO2-eq).125 In Trinidad and Tobago, more than 40% of natural gas \nconsumption is used to produce hydrogen. In the rest of LAC, this share ranges \nfrom 3% to 14% of domestic demand (Figure 8.3). However, if only natural gas \nimports were considered, the share used for hydrogen production would be higher \nfor most countries. In Brazil, for example, hydrogen production was equivalent to \n22% of the country's natural gas imports in 2022, as the country imported nearly \n30% of its natural gas demand.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n124 Including non-energy uses, such as the use of hydrogen as a feedstock for chemicals. \n125 This includes direct emissions from hydrogen production and around 15 Mt of CO2 utilised in the synthesis of urea and \nmethanol, the majority of which is later emitted.

With its abundant \nand cost-competitive renewable energy resources, LAC is well positioned to \nproduce low-emissions hydrogen, which could even be cheaper than domestic \nnatural gas-based production, as it is a net natural gas importer and has higher \nnatural gas prices than regions that are major exporters, meaning that the cost \ngap would be smaller (Figure 8.4). With ambitious policies and decisive action, the \nregion could reap the benefits of this renewable energy potential, using low-\nemissions hydrogen production as a catalyst for job creation, more productive \nindustry, and ultimately, greater development. To achieve competitive low-\nemissions hydrogen production costs, the cost of capital in the region must be \ncomparable to other parts of the world. Without appropriate risk mitigation \nmeasures, a higher cost of capital could undermine the benefits of the region's \ngood renewable resources (see Bringing down the cost of capital). \n \n \n \n \n-60%\n-40%\n-20%\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nArgentina\nBrazil\nChile\nColombia\nMexico\nTrinidad and Tobago\nVenezuela\nShare of natural gas \nShare of NG supply for H₂ production\nShare of NG net imports in supply\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

CAPEX, OPEX and natural gas prices vary per region. The cost of capital is assumed to be 9% for all regions.  \nLAC can produce electrolytic hydrogen more cheaply than many other regions of the world, \nand in some cases even more cheaply than domestic fossil-based hydrogen. \nBrazil published a hydrogen roadmap as early as 2005, and Argentina enacted a \nlaw to promote hydrogen in 2006. More recently, LAC countries have made \nprogress in the low-emissions hydrogen sector. Chile led the way by publishing \nthe region's first national hydrogen strategy in 2020, focusing on electrolytic \nhydrogen, followed by Colombia in 2021 and Uruguay in 2023. In 2023, Argentina, \nBrazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Panama also presented their national hydrogen \nstrategies.

It also reflects LAC’s low-\nemissions hydrogen deployment goals as defined in their national strategies. \nIn the APS, global hydrogen demand increases by almost 70% by 2035 and more \nthan triples by 2050 compared to 2023 levels. In LAC, hydrogen demand, excluding \ndemand for exports, increases by about 90% by 2035 and nearly quadruples by 2050 \n(Figure 8.5). The share of hydrogen demand for use in new applications in LAC \naccounts for close to 20% in 2035 and 60% in 2050, which would be lower than the \nworld average of 40% and 70%, respectively. In the APS, hydrogen production in LAC \nis driven by relatively ambitious policy goals for low-emissions hydrogen deployment. \nHowever, while some production may be intended for domestic use, LAC’s demand \npolicy goals remain somewhat modest and production would be more likely to be \ndirected towards exports to meet overseas demand, mainly in the form of hydrogen-\nbased fuels. About 3 Mt H2-eq in the APS in 2035, and 9 Mt H2-eq by 2050 are \nexported in the form of hydrogen-based fuels, mostly in the form of ammonia to \nEurope (for shipping applications) and Japan and Korea (for both shipping \napplications and power generation), but also to Europe as synthetic aviation fuels.  \nFigure 8.5 \nHydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels demand and exports by sector in \nLatin America and the Caribbean in the Announced Pledges Scenario, \n2023-2050 \n \nIEA.

The IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) provides an outlook based \non current policy settings, which can give a better sense of the exports of \nhydrogen-based fuels that could be achieved in the region based on how the \nenergy sector is evolving globally. In the STEPS, hydrogen and hydrogen-based \nfuels exports from Latin America account for 1.7 Mt H2-eq by 2035 and close to \n6 Mt H2-eq by 2050. In this case, these exports are driven by the mandates \nadopted in Europe for the use of hydrogen-derived fuels in aviation and shipping \nand the supportive policies for the adoption of ammonia in power generation in \nJapan and Korea.  \nAt the global level, the share of low-emissions hydrogen production accounts for \nclose to 50% of the total in 2035 in the APS, rising to 80% in 2050. In LAC in the \nAPS, the share is significantly higher, reaching 60% in 2035, 10 percentage points \nabove the global average, and 85% in 2050. This highlights the region’s potential \nfor significant growth in low-emissions hydrogen production compared to other \nparts of the world, driven by its abundant renewable energy resources and strong \ntargets. However, more ambitious demand policies would be needed to boost \ndomestic use and enhance the contribution of low-emissions hydrogen to the \nregion’s decarbonisation efforts. \nLow-emissions hydrogen production \nIn LAC countries, the only low-emissions hydrogen projects announced so far are \nbased on water electrolysis, although other technologies are being considered. \nFor example, a demonstration project in Brazil is exploring bioethanol reforming \nto hydrogen. If all announced projects are realised, annual electrolytic hydrogen \nproduction could reach more than 7 Mt H2 by 2030 (Figure 8.6). This would \nrepresent around 20% of the world's total announced electrolytic hydrogen \nproduction and 15% of all low-emissions hydrogen projects, including those \nplanning to use fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), in \nthe rest of the world. However, the status of these projects varies considerably, \nwith only 0.2% in operation, under construction or having reached FID, compared \nto 8% globally. Around 45% of projects are at a very early stage, which is similar \nto the global average, while the remainder are undergoing feasibility studies.  \n \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

Currently, most projects \nin operation or at FID in LAC are relatively small (<5 MW of electrolysis capacity), \nwith only a few larger initiatives. Notably, a 25 MW electrolyser at Industrias \nCachimayo in Peru has been producing hydrogen for ammonium nitrate, used in \nmining explosives, for nearly six decades. The largest project under construction \nis Unigel's 60 MW electrolysis project in Brazil for the production of ammonia. \nChile accounts for half the potential production of all project announcements in the \nregion: low-emissions hydrogen production could reach close to 3.5 Mtpa H2 by \n2030 if all projects come to fruition (close to 2 Mtpa H2 if excluding projects at very \nearly stages of development). Brazil follows with an announced potential \nproduction of more than 2 Mtpa H2 by 2030 (more than 1 Mtpa H2 if excluding \nprojects at very early stages). Together, Brazil and Chile account for 80% of the \npotential production from project announcements. Panama and Colombia \naccounts for the third and fourth largest potential production, with around \n0.4 Mtpa H2 by 2030 each (0.2 Mtpa H2 if excluding projects at very early stages), \nwith the rest of the countries in the region having announcements for 200 ktpa of \nlow-emissions hydrogen or less. \n0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\nBy country\nBy size\nBy status\nMt H₂-eq\nEarly stages\nFeasibility\nFID/Construction\nOperational\n>1000 MW\n100-1 000 MW\n<100 MW\nOther\nChile\nColombia\nBrazil\nStatus\nSize\nCountry\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

If these projects were to rely solely on \ndedicated electricity from wind and solar PV, generation from these sources would \nneed to increase by 1.4 times today's levels just for the purpose of hydrogen \nproduction. In Brazil and Uruguay, this would mean nearly doubling current wind \nand solar power generation within this decade. In Chile, a close to eightfold \nincrease in solar and wind generation would be needed, while Colombia would \nneed to rapidly scale up from its current low levels of variable renewable \ngeneration. \nFigure 8.7 \nPotential electricity demand for electrolytic hydrogen production from \nannounced projects in Latin America and the Caribbean, 2030, and \nelectricity generation, 2022 \n \nIEA.

This would also require significant improvements in power \ntransmission and grid flexibility to support the increased capacity, especially in \nregions that are currently somewhat isolated or lack robust grid connections. \nThese regions could also benefit from surplus electricity from solar PV and wind, \nminimising curtailment and maximising resource use. It is important to note that \nthe lead times for the planning and construction of major electricity grid assets, \nsuch as electricity transmission lines, are often long and typically exceed the \ndevelopment timelines of the production projects that will be connected to them. \nThis underlines the critical need for comprehensive and early planning of electricity \ntransmission networks to accommodate the potential growth of low-emissions \nhydrogen projects, including a higher regional power integration.  \nFigure 8.8 \nAnnounced low-emissions hydrogen projects in Latin America and the \nCaribbean, 2030, and installed electricity generation capacity and power \ntransmission lines, 2022 \n \nSources: IEA analysis based on IEA Hydrogen Production Projects Database (October 2024); Open infra map (2023), \nElectricity grids; Global Energy Monitor (2022), Global renewable power tracker. \nThe largest electrolytic hydrogen projects planned by 2030 in LAC are in regions with good \nsolar and wind potential, with smaller projects near large hydropower plants. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 246  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nBox 8.1 \nPotential emissions intensity of announced electrolytic \nhydrogen projects in LAC \nAlmost all the announced low-emissions hydrogen projects in LAC plan to produce \nhydrogen by water electrolysis, for which emissions are determined by the \nupstream and midstream emissions of electricity generation. Most projects have \nannounced the use of renewable electricity, often using dedicated supplies. \nHowever, in many cases the electricity will be supplied through the grid (along with \nthe use of certificates to ensure the renewable origin), or some grid electricity may \nbe used to ensure smoother electrolyser operation and contribute to grid stability. \nWhen powered solely by directly connected renewables, hydrogen emissions \nwould be zero (excluding embedded emissions from the assets, see Chapter 7. \nGHG emissions of hydrogen and its derivatives). However, the use of grid \nelectricity can result in different emission levels depending on the electricity mix \nand operation. If today's global average grid electricity with a CO2 intensity of \naround 460 g CO2-eq/kWh were to be used, hydrogen would have an emissions \nintensity of 24 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, similar to hydrogen produced from unabated coal. \nIn LAC, most countries have a grid emission factor below the global average, \nexcept for countries in the Caribbean, Suriname and Guyana. As a result of LAC's \nhigher renewable energy penetration, which is more than double the global \naverage, the region's average CO2 intensity is about 200 g CO2-eq/kWh, which \nwould result in emissions of about 10 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, comparable to hydrogen \nproduced from natural gas reforming. Based on announced projects, by 2030 LAC \ncould produce more than 7 Mtpa of hydrogen (almost all of the total announced \nproduction potential) with a carbon intensity below 3 kg CO2-eq/kg H2, which would \nmake it compliant with several already-existing regulations around the world, such \nas the EU Taxonomy (<3 kg CO2-eq/kg H2), Japan’s Hydrogen Society Promotion \nAct (<3.4 kg CO2-eq/kg H2) and the US Clean Hydrogen Production Standard \n(CHPS, <4 kg CO2-eq/kg H2). Moreover, if all the announced projects were \nconnected to the grid without buying guarantees of origin for the electricity used in \nits production, the region would still be able to produce 3 Mtpa compliant with the \nEU Taxonomy and around 3.5 Mtpa compliant with the CHPS.  \nThe emissions associated with hydrogen production will vary significantly \ndepending on the pace of grid decarbonisation and potential disruptions to \nhydropower generation due to climate change, such as fluctuating rainfall patterns. \nThe strategic use of grid electricity, if properly managed, could offer benefits like \nminimising the curtailment of renewable energy and improving overall grid stability, \nmaking it a potentially valuable complement to dedicated renewable energy \nsources in hydrogen production. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: Electrolytic production refers to low-temperature water electrolysis with an assumed overall electricity demand of \n50 kWh/kg H2, including compression to 30 bar. The grid electricity intensities include direct CO2, methane (CH4) and \nnitrous oxide (N2O) emissions at the power plants, but not upstream and midstream emissions for the fuels used in the \npower plants. It is assumed that renewable electricity from wind, solar PV, hydropower and geothermal energy has zero \nupstream and direct emissions. Intensities of grid electricity considered are in line with the projected electricity \ngeneration in the APS. Emissions intensity of the year a project comes online is used for the grid-connected \nconfiguration. \nLow-emissions hydrogen demand \nLatin America is experiencing a surge in announced hydrogen production projects, \ndriven primarily by the expectation that a global market will develop, allowing the \nregion to become an exporter of low-emissions hydrogen, rather than by \nexpectations for domestic demand. More recently, however, some countries have \nbegun to explore the potential of their domestic markets, such as Brazil's interest \nin using low-emissions hydrogen for fertiliser production. Currently, the market for \nlow-emissions hydrogen within the region is limited, with few operational projects \n(most are demonstration projects) and offtake agreements (mostly preliminary \nagreements with no binding conditions). The export focus of most of the \nannounced projects highlights the region's potential to become a major player in \nthe emerging global market for low-emissions hydrogen. Realising these \nambitious plans within this decade would require addressing uncertainty around \nregulation and certification for global trade, the lack of export/import infrastructure \nat the required scale, and limited demand creation in the potential export markets \nthat could facilitate offtake.  \nWith the exception of Costa Rica and Mexico, which have diversified their exports \nsomewhat in the last two decades, most major Latin American economies have \nsimplified their export profiles and reduced the complexity of their domestic \neconomies. This shift has led to a decline in exports of high-value goods and an \nincreased reliance on commodity exports, particularly in agriculture and mining. \n0\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n 10\n 12\n 14\n 16\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nEmissions intensity (kg CO₂-eq/kg \nH₂)\nGrid-connected\nAnnounced\nconfiguration\nCumulative production by 2030 (Mt H2/yr)\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 248  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nAnalysis suggests that if the region's low-emissions hydrogen export potential \nrelies solely on commodity exports rather than high-value goods, it will remain \nmore vulnerable to economic shocks. Relying solely on the export of a few \ncommodities is risky. For example, announced projects indicate that 8 Mt of \nammonia would be available for export by 2030 (6.5 Mt if excluding projects at \nvery early stages of development), while the current global trade of anhydrous \nammonia is 20 Mtpa (see Chapter 4. Trade and infrastructure). The production \nfrom announced projects would therefore be close to half of the current global \ntrade volume, and this is unlikely to be fully absorbed by the market in such a short \ntimeframe, especially as technologies for converting ammonia back to pure \nhydrogen, or for use in new applications as a fuel (such as in shipping and power \ngeneration), are not yet mature. To bridge the gap between project \nannouncements and actual implementation, the region will need to stimulate \ndomestic demand for low-emissions hydrogen. This will also need to include \nstimulating demand within the industrial sector for the production of low-emissions \nproducts that could achieve higher value on the global market. Across all projects, \nthe initial scale-up phase will be crucial for gaining the experience and knowledge \nneeded for long-term success, both domestically and in export markets.  \nIn the following sections, we explore the potential for LAC to use low-emissions \nhydrogen in various applications that would present the best opportunities for the \nregion in the short term, given its major economic sectors today. These include \nthe production of nitrogen-based fertilisers for agriculture, the reduction of iron ore \nto hot briquetted iron for steel production, the production of bulk explosives and \nthe use of hydrogen in heavy machinery in the mining sector, the production of \nhydrogen-based fuels for aviation and shipping, and its use in the desulphurisation \nprocess during refining. \nAgriculture: nitrogen-based fertilisers \nAmmonia (NH3) represented about a third of the hydrogen demand in LAC in 2023, \nwith over 85% of production concentrated in Trinidad and Tobago, Brazil and \nArgentina. Ammonia can be used in its pure form or converted to other nitrogen \ncompounds like urea, nitric acid and ammonium nitrate, among others, that can \nultimately be used for agriculture, as well as other applications. At a global level \nand within LAC, around 70% of ammonia is used for fertiliser applications. \nExcluding Trinidad and Tobago, the region is a net importer of ammonia (44% of \ndemand)128 and a net importer of nitrogen-based fertilisers.129 Fertiliser demand \n \n \n128 The region is a net exporter of ammonia (exporting nearly a third of production), but this reflects the distorting effect of \nTrinidad and Tobago, which exports 80% of its production and represents almost two-thirds of ammonia production in the \nregion. \n129 Hereafter referred to as “fertiliser”. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 249  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nin LAC accounted for almost 16 Mt NH3-eq in 2021,130 of which only 20% was met \nby domestic production (Figure 8.9). A total of 21 countries in the region, \nrepresenting 10% of LAC’s fertiliser demand, satisfy 100% of their demand with \nimports. This includes countries where agriculture represents more than 10% of \nthe GDP, like Bolivia, Paraguay, Honduras and Nicaragua. Brazil is responsible \nfor almost 55% of LAC’s fertiliser demand, of which 90% is satisfied by imports. \nArgentina, Colombia and Mexico and Argentina represent close to 25% of total \ndemand and import 18-24% of their fertilisers. Prior to the 2022 energy crisis, \nalmost 25% of the fertiliser imports came from Russia, although its share \ndecreased to 16% in 2023. In contrast, the share of imports from China has \ndoubled in the last 5 years from 10% in 2018 to 20% in 2023, with imports from \nthe Middle East and North Africa also increasing from 18% to 24% over the same \nperiod. \nFigure 8.9 \nShare of imports and domestic production for nitrogen-based fertilisers in \nLatin America and the Caribbean, 2021 \n \nIEA.

In relative \nterms, when considering the different sizes of the economies, the trade deficit is \nstill largest in Brazil, equivalent to 0.25-0.4% of its GDP in the last 3 years (Figure \n8.10). This is significant considering Brazil’s GDP growth in 2024 is estimated to \nbe 2.2%. For other countries such as Guyana, Honduras, Nicaragua and Uruguay, \nthe share of imports has also fluctuated in the range of 0.3-0.7% of GDP in the \nlast 3 years, with other countries having smaller shares. \nFigure 8.10 Traded deficit of nitrogen-based fertilisers in selected Latin American \ncountries as a function of GDP, 2020-2023 \n \nIEA.

Although this is largely due to the unforeseen energy crisis of 2022, \nit also reveals one of the challenges of LAC’s fossil-based system – the exposure \nto price volatility due to market disruptions and short-term trends. During the same \nperiod, the price of ammonia,131 mostly produced from hydrogen from natural gas \n(except in China, where coal-based production is the main route), has fluctuated \nbetween USD 230/t NH3 and USD 1 140/t NH3 – a factor of almost 5 (Figure 8.11). \nIn contrast, electrolytic ammonia production has the advantage that the largest \nshare of the cost comes from the capital investment and financing costs, which \nare fixed at the time of making an investment decision, leading to predictable \n \n \n131 Based on free on-board price of ammonia in the Middle East.

If all the demand for \nammonia and nitrogen-based fertilisers in LAC were satisfied with 2.8 Mtpa of \ndomestic electrolytic hydrogen production, 35-80 GW of renewable capacity would \nbe required,133 compared with a total installed capacity of solar PV and wind in the \nregion of 123 GW in 2023. Such a change would require an investment of \nUSD 95-100 billion for the renewable energy, electrolyser and ammonia synthesis \nunits. This investment is of similar magnitude to what Chile would need \n(USD 74 billion) until 2030 to keep up with expected growth in copper demand \naccelerated by the energy transition. One limitation of switching to electrolytic \nammonia is that the conventional production route from natural gas includes \ncarbon capture, and the captured CO2 is used for making urea. Urea accounts for \n55% of the demand of nitrogen-based fertilisers in LAC and would require over \n10 Mtpa CO2. The fossil CO2 could be replaced with biogenic CO2, but this would \ncompete with other CO2 uses (see Figure 8.19). \nIf all the announced projects for the production of low-emissions ammonia in LAC \nmaterialise, they would produce 2.8 Mtpa H2 by 2030 (1.8 Mtpa if excluding \nprojects at very early stages of development), equivalent to 16 Mtpa NH3 \n(10 Mtpa NH3), i.e. equivalent to the volume needed to satisfy the domestic \nfertiliser demand today (although it would compete with ammonia demand as a \nshipping fuel). This is also significantly larger than the demand for low-emissions \nhydrogen for ammonia production to be used in fertiliser manufacturing in the APS, \nwhich is around 0.6 Mtpa H2 by 2035 and close to 2 Mtpa H2 by 2050 for the \nregion. Of this announced capacity, 60% is in Chile, with another 25% in Brazil. \nThe largest project outside these two countries is a 1.65 Mt NH3 project in Peru, \nwhich was undergoing an environmental impact assessment in April 2024. \nHowever, close to 40% of the project pipeline is at very early stages of \ndevelopment and the remaining 60% at the feasibility stage, and only one 60 MW \nproject in Brazil and one 50 MW project in Colombia have reached FID. Many of \nthese projects are targeting export, but even if only a small share of them \nmaterialise, they would still be sufficient to contribute to improving the trade \nbalance. \nFigure 8.11 Ammonia spot prices (2021-2024) in comparison to low-emissions \nammonia production costs in the Announced Pledges Scenario in Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean, 2030 \n \n \n132 Annual production costs will still vary depending on the weather year, and profit will still vary since prices are determined \nby supply and demand in the market. \n133 Lower bound for onshore wind and upper bound for solar PV.

In addition, it also includes financing targets, such as attracting at \nleast USD 10 billion of private capital to expand domestic fertiliser production by \n2030. The strategy is now being implemented, with multiple financial incentives in \nplace to promote fertiliser production, including long-term credits from the National \nBank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), which has already funded \na fertiliser plant in Paranaguá, and financing for R&D projects through the \ngovernment financing agency (FINEP). \nSteelmaking and hot briquetted iron trade \nLAC holds about one-fifth of the world’s iron ore reserves. In 2022, the iron ore \nmarket in the region was valued at USD 50 billion, making it the second largest \nmining market after copper, which was valued at USD 70 billion. The largest iron \nore deposits in the region are located in Brazil, and support both the domestic iron \nand steel industry as well as significant export activities. \nIn 2023, the region accounted for 20% of the world’s iron ore trade in monetary \nterms, with Brazil accounting for almost 90% of this. LAC is the largest exporter of \niron ore to India, the second largest to China and Europe (after Australia) and the \nthird largest to Japan.

Iron \nore reduction and steelmaking are currently co-located, strategically positioned in \nproximity or with efficient trade routes between upstream metallurgical coal and \niron ore mines and downstream markets for steel consumption. However, in the \nfuture, high energy and hydrogen costs in some regions might encourage the \nrelocation of reduction processes to regions with good renewable energy \nresources and iron ore deposits, if near-zero production routes are pursued. This \nshift could realign the supply chain and lead to the emergence of global production \nhubs for pure forms of iron. Hydrogen-based iron ore reduction produces hot \nbriquetted iron (HBI), a compact form of direct reduced iron (DRI) that can be \nshipped long distances and later melted into steel in an electric arc furnace (EAF), \ntypically with supplementary steel scrap, which is more abundant in developed \neconomies (Figure 8.12). \nFigure 8.12 Potential supply chains for hydrogen-based direct reduced iron \nsteelmaking \n \nNote: DRI = direct reduced iron; HBI = hot briquetted iron. \nLAC can attract industrial activity within the iron and steel supply chain, beyond today’s \nexport of iron ore, thanks to its potential to produce low-emissions hydrogen at low cost. \nMost existing hydrogen strategies in the region focus on trade options for \nammonia, methanol and synthetic fuels, without considering steel produced with \nlow-emissions hydrogen. In contrast, recent hydrogen strategies in Mauritania, \nNamibia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States have begun to highlight \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 254  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nthe importance of near-zero emissions steel. 134 LAC has great potential to deploy \nlow-emissions hydrogen-based iron ore reduction technologies (Figure 8.13) to \ntransition from an extractive industry to a manufacturing one, either to export HBI, \nwhich adds more value than exporting iron ore alone, or to export steel. In the \nAPS, around 0.15 Mtpa of low-emissions hydrogen is used for steel manufacturing \nin Latin America by 2035. This demand grows up to 1.5 Mtpa by 2050.  \nH2-DRI plants require high-grade iron ore, typically containing above 67% iron, \nwhich currently represents only 4% of global iron ore shipments. Brazil is the \nlargest producer of high-grade iron ore, and Brazilian mining company Vale \nexpects demand for DR-grade iron ore will increase over time, while demand for \nthe benchmark 62% (blast-furnace-grade) iron ore will decline. As a result, the \nfocus is shifting towards increasing the quality rather than the quantity of the iron \nore output. Lower-grade ores could be used in H2-DRI plants after beneficiation,135 \na process that upgrades the quality of the ore by removing impurities and gangue \nminerals. While Brazil ranks as the second largest iron ore producer globally, \nbehind Australia, 96% of Australian iron ore exports consist of lower-grade \nhematite, which cannot yet be efficiently processed in electric arc furnaces. \nAlthough new technologies are being developed to use lower-grade iron ores \nmore efficiently, LAC would be uniquely positioned to play a key role in supplying \niron ore suitable for H2 DRI production.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n134 See the IEA's report on Achieving Net Zero Heavy Industries in G7 Members for more information on the definition of \n'near-zero emission steel production'. In this report, the term is used less precisely to refer to steel production from iron ore \nwith innovative technologies that can achieve substantial reductions in emissions intensity, such as hydrogen-based DRI \nsteel production. \n135 Depending on the degree of beneficiation required and the type of ore, crushing, screening and grinding processes are \nutilised in conjunction with flotation, gravity or magnetic separation. For low-quality magnetite ores (Fe3O4) beneficiation \nprocesses are advanced, while further innovation is needed for hematite (Fe2O3) and goethite (FeO2H) ores. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

Today, iron ore \nexports represent approximately 30% of the total dry bulk market, making iron ore \nthe largest single commodity within the dry bulk sector, outpacing other major \ncommodities like coal. \nHBI is denser than iron ore, which would reduce the transport volume and shipping \ncosts. In addition, transporting hydrogen or hydrogen-based fuels over long \ndistances can cost up to USD 2/kg H2, and although this has a relatively minor \nimpact on the HBI production cost, as approximately less than 60 Kg H2 (6% ratio \nin mass terms) are consumed per tonne of HBI, that cost can also be minimised.  \n \n \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 256  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nFigure 8.14 Impact of hydrogen and iron ore shipping costs on the cost of producing \nhot briquetted iron, 2023 \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: H₂ = hydrogen; HBI = hot briquetted iron; NH₃ = ammonia. Dry bulk carriers are used to transport iron ore and HBI \n12 000 km to their importing country. It is assumed that direct reduction is used to reduce iron ore pellets into metallic iron \nto achieve a 94% metallisation, i.e. the percentage of metallic iron out of the total iron content (%Fe out of iron oxide \n[FeO]). Ore cost adjustments are modelled as a function of the Fe-content. Ammonia shipped to provide hydrogen at the \nDRI facility includes the costs associated with ammonia cracking. \nTransporting HBI significantly lowers costs compared to transporting iron ore and \nhydrogen separately. \nIn 2023, LAC exported more than 400 Mt of iron ore. If all of this were converted \nto HBI for export, it would require more than 25 Mt of hydrogen. While unlikely at \nsuch scale, as some iron ore importing countries have ample renewable energy \nresources to produce HBI themselves, there are countries with limited renewable \nresources that could benefit from locating HBI production in LAC and focusing on \ndomestic steelmaking. This would allow them to produce steel close to the end \nuser and facilitate the recycling of steel scrap using EAFs, whose availability may \nbe limited in iron ore exporting countries. This approach could reduce overall costs \nby up to a third. If half of LAC's current iron ore exports to Europe, Japan and \nKorea – approximately 30 Mt of iron ore – were in the form of HBI, the region would \nneed almost 2 Mt of hydrogen to produce around 20 Mt of HBI for export, with an \ninvestment for the hydrogen-based reduction process alone of almost \nUSD 20 billion.  \n \n \n \n \n0\n 3\n 6\n 9\n 12\n 15\nHBI\nIron ore\n(no H₂ transport)\nIron ore\n(H₂, 3 000 km)\nIron ore\n(H₂, 12 000 km)\nIron ore\n(NH₃, 12 000 km)\nUSD/ t HBI at the importing country\nAmmonia\nNew 20-inch\nH₂ pipeline\nDry bulk transport\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: HBI = hot briquetted iron; LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; RE = renewable energy. For HBI production, \ndomestic production of hydrogen is assumed, and not imported hydrogen. The cost of HBI reflects its cost at the gate of the \nsteelmaking plant, i.e. the costs associated with HBI production in LAC and shipping HBI (left) and the costs associated \nwith iron ore shipping and HBI production in the importing country next to the steelmaking plant (right). Land transportation \ncosts are excluded. \nIn regions with moderate renewable energy resources, importing HBI from LAC instead of \niron ore could cut the cost of reduced iron by almost a third. \nLAC has significant export potential for HBI, but there could also be growing \ndomestic demand for near-zero emissions steel, especially as countries work to \nmeet their decarbonisation commitments. Globally, steelmaking accounts for more \nthan 7% of energy-related GHG emissions. In LAC, steelmaking accounts for \naround 4% of emissions, totalling more than 65 Mt CO2 per year – almost \nequivalent to 80% of all of Colombia's CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. \nAlthough near-zero emissions steel may initially carry a price premium, as \ntechnologies mature and prices come down, it could be more easily adopted by \ncertain sectors. Sectors where steel consumption represents a small proportion of \ncosts and is therefore less price sensitive are the most likely candidates. In LAC, \naround half of steel consumption is in the construction sector, followed by the \nautomotive and machinery sectors, each accounting for more than 16% of steel \nconsumption in 2022. While the construction sector has tight margins, in the \nautomotive sector the steel cost is a small part of the total cost of the vehicle, \ntypically only a few hundred dollars. This would make it easier to absorb the \npremium for near-zero emissions steel, particularly for premium cars. \nIf the region were to meet all of its automotive steel needs with 100%-H2 DRI, it \nwould require approximately 11 Mt of steel (if equivalent to the consumption in \n2022, with an estimate of the total apparent finished steel use in the region of \n68 Mt of steel).

Carmakers are increasingly \nentering into agreements to purchase near-zero emissions steel to reduce their \nembedded emissions. Examples include GM's agreement with ArcelorMittal, \nVolvo Cars with SSAB and HYBRIT, Ford with Tata, Volkswagen with Salzgitter \nand BMW with HBIS. LAC could capitalise on this trend by offering near-zero \nemissions steel to the automotive industry in the region, thereby also encouraging \ncar manufacturers to locate there, as well as attracting other industries. \nCountries such as Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and Chile have the potential to \nbecome major players in the global near-zero emissions steel market. For \nexample, Brazilian iron ore mining company Vale will supply iron ore pellets for \nthe 100%-H2 DRI plant that Stegra (formerly H2 Green Steel) is constructing in \nBoden, Sweden. In addition, Vale and Stegra signed an agreement in September \n2023 to evaluate the feasibility of producing HBI in Brazil. As there are currently \nno commercially available 100% H2-DRI plants in the world, innovation and \ninternational co-operation, including technology transfer, will be critical. By \ndeveloping hydrogen-based iron ore reduction and harnessing the region's \nabundant renewable energy resources, LAC can position itself as a leader in near-\nzero emissions steel production. \nMining: explosives and machinery \nThe mining sector contributes around 5% of Latin America’s GDP, a share \ncomparable to that of agriculture, and reaching over 12% in some countries, such \nas Chile and Peru. The region has some of the world’s largest mineral reserves, \nincluding copper, iron ore, gold, silver and lithium, and some of the largest \nproducers. Chile is the world’s leading producer of copper, followed by Peru, and \nBrazil is the world’s second largest producer of iron ore and fourth largest producer \nof bauxite. In addition, the region’s mining industry has been growing steadily, \ndriven by significant investments in mining projects. \nMining is a significant emitter of GHGs due to its energy-intensive extraction and \nprocessing activities. To improve market access, bolster their reputation and align \nwith stringent environmental, social and governance standards, mining companies \nare increasingly committing to reduce their emissions. As a result, several \ncompanies in the region (e.g. Anglo American, Antofagasta Minerals, BHP, \nCollahuasi and Codelco) have announced decarbonisation strategies. The use of \nlow-emissions hydrogen could help decarbonise the sector in two main areas in \nwhich direct electrification is difficult: explosives and heavy machinery and trucks.  \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 259  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nBulk explosives \nRising investments in mining, particularly in copper, are likely to further support \nthe expansion of the mining sector in LAC and increase the demand for \nexplosives. In LAC, ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO, composed of around 94% \nammonium nitrate and 6% fuel oil) is the most frequently used explosive in mining. \nAs interest in sustainable mining practices grows, low-emissions ammonia can be \nused instead of fossil-based ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate for ANFO \nand other industrial explosives, helping to reduce upstream emissions from \nmining. \nLeading ammonium nitrate producers, including Enaex (Chile), Incitec Pivot \n(Australia), and Queensland Nitrates (Australia) have announced low-emissions \nammonia projects. Orica has signed an MoU with Fertiberia for the supply of low-\nemissions technical ammonium nitrate and successfully completed the first test \nblasts with it in Spain in 2024. It is also worth noting that Industrias Cachimayo in \nPeru, which became part of Chilean Enaex in 2018, has operated an ammonium \nnitrate production plant since 1965. This plant uses hydrogen produced by an \nelectrolyser with capacity around 25 MW, which until 2021 was the largest in the \nworld, and since 2022 the plant has been certified to use renewable electricity. \nLAC consumed around 1.5 Mt of explosives in 2023 (less than 10% of the global \nmarket), predominantly ammonium nitrate used in mining. If all of the demand \nwere met using ammonium nitrate, more than 630 kt of ammonia 136 and more \nthan 100 kt of hydrogen would be required to produce it. Some experts expect an \nincrease in consumption of explosives in the region at a compound annual growth \nrate between 5% and 8% in the next decade, which would imply that demand for \nhydrogen could rise to around 180 ktpa by 2032.137 The use of domestic, low-\nemissions hydrogen would help to reduce scope 3 emissions from mining \ncompanies, positioning them as leaders in sustainable mining practices, while \nreducing the need to import ammonia for explosives production. Enaex is currently \ndeveloping the HyEx project in Mejillones (Chile) to produce low-emissions \nammonia, with an initial phase producing 18 ktpa by 2025 and subsequent scale-\nup to 700 ktpa. Enaex aims to meet its current 350 ktpa ammonia import needs \nfor its Prillex America plant (the world's largest explosive grade ammonium nitrate \nplant), and to access a new export market for low-emissions ammonia. \nHeavy machinery \nIn LAC, the mining sector is a major consumer of energy, accounting for more than \n4% of the region's total electricity consumption and almost 2% of its oil \n \n \n136 This includes the ammonia used in the production of both ammonium nitrate and nitric acid for ammonium nitrate. \n137 New explosives may also include nitrate-free and ammonia-free explosives solutions for the mining industry, but this \npotential reduction in ammonium nitrate consumption is not taken into account. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 260  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nconsumption, which is more than twice the global average. This points to both a \ncritical need to decarbonise the mining sector to meet national decarbonisation \ntargets, and a unique opportunity for the region to lead in pioneering solutions at \nmining sites. \nIn addition to switching to renewable electricity, a key focus is on reducing \nemissions from diesel-powered mobile equipment such as haul trucks, bulldozers \nand excavators. In October 2021, the International Council on Mining & Metals, \nwhich includes several mining companies operating in LAC, committed to \nachieving net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050, and launched the \nInnovation for Cleaner Safer Vehicles initiative to trial both hydrogen fuel cells and \nbattery electric vehicles (BEVs) at surface mining operations. Hydrogen trucks are \nbeing considered given that fully electrifying the largest mining equipment may be \nchallenging, requiring batteries in the megawatt hours (MWh) range (compared to \nless than 100 kWh batteries used in light EVs), which would enormously increase \nbattery size and weight. \nAs both BEVs and hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technology for large mobile mining \nequipment are still in the demonstration phase, both alternatives are being \nconsidered by mining companies, given that there are uncertainties as to how the \nperformance and cost of the technology will evolve, and thus which option would \nbe the most cost effective. In 2022, Anglo American unveiled a prototype of a \nhydrogen-battery hybrid truck with a 0.8 MW hydrogen fuel cell capacity and a \n290 t payload, and in January 2024, GM and Komatsu announced their \ncollaboration to develop a 2 MW hydrogen fuel cell-powered mining truck with a \n320 t payload. Elsewhere, in Australia, other companies such as BHP, Fortescue \nand Rio Tinto are prioritising batteries over hydrogen.  \nIf the equivalent of 50% of diesel consumption in mining equipment in 2022 in LAC \nwere replaced by low-emissions hydrogen, it would represent a demand for almost \n0.8 Mt H2. Fuel consumption for machinery could grow as mining in the region \nincreases. Low-emissions hydrogen could therefore play a significant role in \ndecarbonising mining in LAC, particularly in energy-intensive mining hubs such as \nChile's copper mines, which account for around half of all diesel used by mining \noperations in the region. \nHydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels for aviation and \nshipping \nAviation and shipping are sectors in which emissions are typically thought of as \nhard to abate, due to the size of the aircraft and vessels, and their long-distance \noperations, which limit the potential for electrification and increase reliance on fuel-\nbased solutions for decarbonisation. Biofuels, such as biojet kerosene, can \ncontribute to reducing the sector’s emissions, but their potential is limited by the \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 261  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \namount of feedstock that can be sustainably sourced. Instead, synthetic fuels, \nproduced from hydrogen and a sustainable carbon source, will become \nincreasingly attractive over time given that the availability of sustainable biomass \nfor biofuel production is limited (see Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand). Hydrogen can \nimprove biomass-to-liquid production (via biomass gasification and Fischer-\nTropsch synthesis) by increasing fuel yield. In addition, synthetic fuels can be \nproduced from hydrogen combined with biogenic or atmospheric CO2 sourced via \ndirect air capture (DAC), although DAC technology remains costly. Harnessing \nLAC's abundant biogenic CO2 resources – from bioethanol, biogas or the pulp and \npaper industry – together with its bioenergy potential, can significantly increase \nthe region's capacity to produce low-emissions fuels for aviation and shipping. In \nthe APS, demand for low-emissions hydrogen for the production of these fuels \nreaches up to 1.2 Mt by 2035 and more than 3 Mt by 2050. \nAviation fuels \nAviation is the fastest-growing transport mode in LAC. In 2023, the energy demand \nfor aviation exceeded 800 PJ, equivalent to over 3% of the region's total final \nenergy demand.138 LAC accounts for almost 6% of global energy demand for \naviation. Virtually all demand is satisfied with fossil fuels (jet fuel) leading to the \nemission of around 60 Mtpa CO2. Demand is concentrated in a few key countries, \nwith Brazil, Mexico and Colombia together accounting for more than 60% of \nregional aviation energy consumption (Figure 8.16), and being home to 13 of the \n15 busiest domestic routes in the region. Within these countries, demand is \nequally concentrated, and the top five airports in each country represent more than \n50% of the national fuel demand. This means that providing sustainable fuel to a \nrelatively small number of airports would be sufficient to shift a relatively large \nshare of the regional demand. There is a large variation in type of journey across \ncountries: in Brazil, almost two-thirds of aviation energy demand comes from \ndomestic flights, while the share in other large countries like Mexico or Argentina \nis much smaller, and the regional average is 29%.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n138 The total final energy demand excludes demand for international bunkering in aviation and shipping, but it is used here to \nprovide a benchmark. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

Fuel use \nfor international aviation reflects fuel consumed by planes with an international destination, irrespective of the nationality of \nthe airline. In some cases, the split in domestic and international aviation is based on estimates.  \nAviation demand in LAC is concentrated, with three countries representing more than 60% \nof the regional energy demand for aviation. \nSustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), such as biojet kerosene and synthetic jet fuel, \ncan be used as drop-in fuels, requiring little to no modification to existing aircraft \nand using the existing transport, storage and distribution infrastructure. Currently, \nthe American Society for Testing and Materials standards allow up to 50% of \nsynthetic fuel to be blended with jet fuel, a share that could potentially increase in \nthe future, allowing the use of pure synthetic fuel. Meeting 50% of today’s aviation \nfuel demand in LAC entirely with synthetic fuels would require 30 Mt CO2 per \nyear139 for fuel production (see CO2 supply and demand section). Satisfying 50% \nof the regional demand with synthetic fuels would require nearly 6 Mtpa of \nelectrolytic hydrogen, which would require 60-70 GW of electrolysis and 80-\n170 GW of renewable capacity. \nSAF production in LAC is currently limited to biofuels, and there is limited support \nfor synthetic fuels, with 19 projects announced and 7 refineries planning to process \nbiofuels. Chile and Brazil are the only countries that have a SAF policy in place. \nIn April 2024, Chile launched a SAF roadmap that includes a workplan for \ndeveloping a regulatory framework by 2026 and the first domestic SAF pilot plant \nin 2030, and sets a target of 50% SAF by 2050.

The bill introduces a GHG reduction target of \n1% in 2027, increasing to 10% in 2037, which could trigger SAF demand, although \na large part of it may come from biofuels (SAF from HEFA [hydroprocessed esters \nand fatty acids]), particularly at the outset. The 2031 10-year energy expansion \nplan foresees SAF uptake of 1.4% by 2031. Colombia is preparing a SAF roadmap \nas part of its Climate Action Act to be published by the end of 2024. Alternative \npolicies relevant to SAF include tax exemptions, which are already common in the \nregion for the supply side (see Chapter 6. Policies), mandates, and crediting \nschemes (as already used in Brazil in the RenovaBio programme, for example). \nCertification will be critical to scaling up SAF uptake, so that the fuel can be clearly \nrecognised for the lower emissions resulting from its production. Towards this aim, \nongoing efforts to certify hydrogen, including from Brazil and Colombia (see \nChapter 6. Policies), would need to be extended to hydrogen derivatives like \nsynthetic fuels. This would also require the definition of standards and \nmethodologies for accounting for the CO2, which is critical to estimating the \nlifecycle GHG emissions from synthetic fuels (see Chapter 7. GHG emissions of \nhydrogen and its derivatives). Experience gained from biofuels certification, which \nalready exists in Brazil, would be useful when setting up a certification scheme for \nsynthetic fuels. \nShipping fuels \nIn 2023, the energy demand for shipping in LAC reached over 570 PJ, \nrepresenting almost 5% of global energy demand for shipping. This demand is \nconcentrated in a few countries, with Brazil, Panama and Argentina representing \nover two-thirds of the regional energy consumption for shipping (Figure 8.17). \nPanama alone accounts for almost a quarter of the total energy demand from \nshipping, mostly for international shipping due to the traffic through the Panama \nCanal. Virtually all of LAC’s shipping demand is currently satisfied with fossil fuels \n(fuel oil and gasoil) leading to the emission of over 40 Mtpa CO2. Over 8 000 ships \n(almost 8% of the global fleet), with a total tonnage equivalent to 16% of the global \ntotal, were registered with Panama’s flag in 2022, emitting over 110 Mtpa CO2,140 \nsecond only to Liberia as the country with most emissions from ships under their \nflag. The total value of merchandise traded by ship from LAC was USD 1.4 trillion \nin 2023 (accounting for almost 6% of the global total). In 2022, nearly a 15% of \nthe value trade in both imports and exports were intra-regional. In 2024, LAC \nrepresents over 21% of the global shipping tonnage. \n \n \n140 Notably, these ships are registered with Panama’s flag, but they do not necessarily have to perform journeys from or to \nPanama ports, so the energy consumption is allocated to the countries that ships depart from or arrive in, and the CO2 \nemissions are allocated to international shipping overseen by the IMO. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

Numbers for 2023 are estimates, since complete data for 2023 were not yet \navailable at the time of writing. Fuel use for international shipping reflects fuel consumed by ships with an international \ndestination, irrespective of the nationality or flag of the ship. In some cases, the split in domestic and international shipping \nis based on estimates.  \nThree countries represent more than two-thirds of regional energy demand for shipping. \nThe low-emissions synthetic fuel alternatives for shipping considered in this report \nare ammonia and methanol, and the pipeline of demonstration projects for \nalternative fuels is growing. By mid-2023, there were more than 370 pilot projects \naround the world, but just 2% of these were in Latin America. However, even if \nthese fuels reach cost parity with heavy fuel oil, their widespread use as shipping \nfuels will require significant investments in compatible bunkering infrastructure and \nships. \nThe investment needs for fuel supply can also be significant. For example, \nsatisfying 10% of the current fuel demand from shipping in the region would \nrequire 3.1 Mtpa of ammonia (0.5 Mtpa of hydrogen). Producing this amount \nwould require 5-7 GW of electrolyser capacity and between 7 GW of onshore wind \nor 15 GW of solar PV. The total production that could be achieved if all announced \nprojects for low-emissions ammonia are realised (almost 2.8 Mtpa of hydrogen by \n2030, or 1.8 Mtpa if excluding projects at very early stages of development) would \nbe more than enough to satisfy this demand. However, part of this will be used to \nsatisfy the existing ammonia demand as industrial feedstock (mainly for fertilisers). \nAbout 0.2% of this capacity is in operation, has reached FID or is at the \nconstruction stage, and almost 40% is at the concept stage, so there is a great \ndeal of uncertainty about most of these projects. \nPanama adopted a hydrogen strategy in April 2023, which sets targets for 2030 of \n5% of bunkering supply being from hydrogen derivatives, including domestic \nproduction of 0.5 Mtpa H2.

Nevertheless, out of 44 green \ncorridor initiatives globally in 2023, only 4 are in Latin America.141 \nCO2 supply and demand \nCO2 embedded in synthetic fuels and urea is ultimately released upon final use. \nAs such, for these fuels to be sustainable, the CO2 must be biogenic or directly \ncaptured from the air (see Chapter 7. GHG emissions of hydrogen and its \nderivatives). If fossil CO2 is used, overall emissions are reduced, since the CO2 is \nused two (or more) times, but the system cannot achieve zero emissions. Another \noption is to use CO2 from unavoidable CO2 emissions, such as in cement \nproduction, where two-thirds of the CO2 emissions are process emissions \n(limestone) rather than from fuel combustion. \nCarbon-containing low-emissions jet fuel and methanol for shipping would require \na massive increase in CO2 utilisation. DAC of CO2 could provide a potentially \nunlimited source of CO2 feedstock with no geographic constraints, but it is \nexpected to remain a high-cost option in 2030. In the short term, therefore, it \nseems more likely that biogenic CO2 sources would be used.  \nBiofuels production offers a significant potential synergy, as by-product CO2 from \nbioethanol and biogas plants is among the cheapest (USD 20 – 30/t CO2) sources \nof CO2, as it is concentrated. As these resources may not be enough to cover the \nentire demand, they could be supplemented by CO2 from pulp making, albeit at a \nhigher cost (USD 70 – 80/t CO2), as the CO2 is more dilute in the flue gas. \nPulp and paper production is the largest source of biogenic CO2. Pulp production \nin LAC was nearly 34 Mt in 2022, resulting in a potential supply of around 70 Mtpa \nCO2.142 Almost three-quarters of production came from Brazil, which together with \nChile and Uruguay represented almost 96% of regional production. In Brazil, \nEletrobras, a major utility company, and Suzano, a pulp and paper company, are \nexploring the production of synthetic fuels from biogenic CO2 and renewable \nhydrogen. Similarly, there is a large potential for biogenic CO2 as a by-product of \nethanol production,143 with Brazil representing almost 85% of the regional \nproduction capacity. In 2023, Brazil produced 33.6 billion litres of ethanol (30% of \n \n \n141 Of which three are in Chile (copper concentrate to China, sulfuric acid for mining, and aquaculture), and one is in Panama. \n142 Assuming a co-production of 2-3 tonnes of biogenic CO2 per each tonne of dry-pulp, depending on the process \nconfiguration and the type of feedstock. \n143 Additional biogenic CO2 resources in the region, such as those from the combustion of sugar cane bagasse and other \nresidual biomass, are not included in this report. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

For cement, \nBrazil and Mexico are the only LAC countries in the global top 14 producing \ncountries, and together they represent less than 3% of global production. \nFigure 8.18 Available biogenic and unavoidable CO2 sources in Latin America and the \nCaribbean, 2023 \n \nNote: Only plants that emit more than 90 ktpa CO2 are illustrated. \nSource: IEA analyses based on IEA (2024), Renewables 2023; Climate TRACE (2024), Emissions Map. \nIn LAC, there are large CO2 resources from the pulp and paper industry and from \ndecentralised bioethanol plants, which may require CO2 handling infrastructure. \nAs an alternative, CO2 from cement plants could also be used. While the use of \nthis CO2 in the production of synthetic fuels is not carbon neutral, it has been \naccepted by some regulations as a transitional measure to create scale, reduce \ncosts and build up the market while other CO2 sources become available at scale \nand more competitive cost. This is the case in the European Union, where non-\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 267  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \npower CO2 sources covered under the Emissions Trading System (which includes \ncement), can be counted within Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin \n(RFNBO) regulations until 2041. Using 20-70% of the CO2 from cement production \nwould be enough to cover the CO2 supply gap in most countries, even if alternative \nmaterials and technological change reduce this source of CO2. \nThe geographical location of available biogenic CO2 and places where it could be \nused must also be considered (Figure 8.18). For example, the bioethanol plants \nin Brazil are mostly located in the centre and south-west, and while that region \nalso has the largest airports (São Paulo, Campinas, Rio de Janeiro) and largest \nport (Porto de Santos), there is also demand in the east of the country (e.g. in the \nstates of Ceará and Piauí), which is relatively far from the biogenic CO2 supply. \nResolving this would require either CO2 transport infrastructure (if volumes are \nlarge enough to justify it) or DAC – both at additional cost – or tapping into other \nunavoidable CO2 sources, like cement. \nOverall in LAC, 30 Mt CO2 would be needed to satisfy 50% of today’s aviation \ndemand with synthetic jet fuel, nearly 40 Mt CO2 to satisfy 100% of today’s \nshipping demand with methanol, and 10 Mt CO2 to meet all of today’s urea \ndemand, together these would be equivalent to 100% of LAC’s potential supply of \nbiogenic CO2. The largest CO2 demand would be from Brazil, at over \n26 Mtpa CO2, but Brazil also has the largest potential supply of biogenic CO2, \nbeing the regional leader in ethanol and pulp and paper, with the result that \npotential supply is almost four times the demand. While there is more than enough \nbiogenic CO2 in the entire region, countries such as Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador \nor Mexico may face a domestic shortage, and need to explore alternative CO2 \nsources. Meanwhile, countries with a surplus of biogenic CO2, such as Uruguay \nor Brazil, could strategically use this surplus to produce and export low-emissions \nhydrogen-based fuels, creating added value compared to exporting hydrogen \nalone. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

Hydrogen demand in refineries is proportional to the throughput and \nthe sulphur content of the crude.144 Total hydrogen demand was about 1 Mt H2 in \n2022, with most of the demand concentrated in Brazil (300 kt H2), Mexico \n(200 kt H2), Colombia (140 kt H2), and Argentina (110 kt H2). In the future, electric \nvehicle (EV) adoption could reduce the demand for oil, and thus decrease refinery \nthroughput and shift the product slate from gasoline to diesel. These two factors \ncould affect the total hydrogen demand and the share of dedicated hydrogen \nproduction. However, EV sales are relatively low across LAC, with only Costa Rica \nreaching a share greater than 4% in 2023, a threshold that was surpassed in China \n– the world’s leading EV market – in 2018. On the basis of already implemented \nand announced policies, oil demand in LAC is expected to remain flat to 2030, but \na larger reduction in demand could start impacting hydrogen demand post-2030. \n \n \n144 Hydrogen is used in refineries for hydrotreatment (removing impurities, especially sulphur) and hydrocracking (upgrading \nheavy residual oils into higher-value products). \n0\n 20\n 40\n 60\n 80\n 100\n 120\nSupply\nDemand\nSupply\nDemand\nSupply\nDemand\nSupply\nDemand\nSupply\nDemand\nSupply\nDemand\nBrazil\nMexico\nPanama\nArgentin\na\nColombi\na\nOther\nLAC\nCO₂ potential and demand (Mtpa)\nEthanol\nPulp and paper\nCement\nAviation\nShipping\nUrea\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 269  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nRefining could be a leading sector for the deployment of low-emissions hydrogen \nin LAC, given that hydrogen is already used and no modifications would be needed \nin order to switch. The sector could also provide economies of scale. A refinery of \n100 kb/d capacity could require an electrolyser of nearly 500 MW to fully satisfy \nits hydrogen demand. Large-scale projects of this kind could be especially \nvaluable for developing experience at the national level among project developers, \nfinancial institutions, engineering and construction companies, and other \nstakeholders in the supply chain. Chile already has a 1 MW project under \nconstruction in Magallanes, and Colombia has 60 MW projects undergoing \nfeasibility studies for the Cartagena and Barrancabermeja refineries. \nNational oil companies could play a role in the uptake of renewable hydrogen in \nrefineries. In Colombia, Ecopetrol has set a target to reduce CO2 (scope 1 and 2 \nemissions) by 25% (compared to 2019) and estimates a potential hydrogen \ndemand of 1 Mtpa in 2040. Further, it estimates that low-emissions hydrogen \ncould deliver 9-11% of its 50% CO2 reduction target (scope 1-3) by 2050, with \ninvestment needs of USD 2.5 billion. In Brazil, Petrobras targets a 30% reduction \nin absolute CO2 emissions by 2030 (from a 2015 baseline). Towards this goal, it \nforesees an investment of USD 300 million in hydrogen and CCUS for the 2024-\n2028 period (out of a total investment of USD 102 billion). Petrobras aims to \nincrease its R&D budget for low-carbon technologies from 15% in 2024 to 30% in \n2028, has set up a USD 1 billion fund for the decarbonisation of its scope 1 and 2 \nemissions, and has joined the national hydrogen association (ABH2). In Mexico, \nin March 2024 Pemex published its 2050 sustainability plan, which includes low-\nemissions hydrogen imports from the United States starting in 2030-2035, and \ndomestic production from 2035. In Argentina, YPF published its 2023-2027 \nbusiness plan in September 2023, targeting a 30% reduction in emissions intensity \nby 2030 (compared to 2017). Renewable hydrogen from wind power in Patagonia \nis covered, but no specific capacity or investment targets are defined. \nMoving towards implementation \nLAC has significant potential for cost-competitive production of low-emissions \nhydrogen and can count on existing demand for hydrogen, both directly and \nthrough imported products such as fertilisers. However, despite this potential, only \n0.1% of announced low-emissions hydrogen projects for 2030 have reached FID, \nwith 85% of these projects targeting the gigawatt scale and requiring multi-billion-\ndollar investments. This has led to doubts about the achievability of hydrogen \nannouncements in the region, and to considerable uncertainty about how many of \nthese projects will materialise in the next decade. As a result, it is not clear that \nLAC will be able to exploit the opportunities that the development of a low-\nemissions hydrogen industry could bring about. \nIn this section, we outline the role that regional hydrogen hubs could play in \nhelping governments and industry stakeholders to kick-start the development of \nsupply chains for low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels in LAC. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 270  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nCreating the first hydrogen hubs in LAC \nThe terms hydrogen hub, hydrogen cluster and hydrogen valley are often used \ninterchangeably to refer to a network of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuel \nproducers and potential users – and infrastructure connecting the two – within the \nsame geographical area. These hubs can act as nodal centres for the \ndevelopment of larger networks and present several benefits in this moment of \nearly market stage development, such as: \n \nCreation of scale through pooling supply and demand. \n \nEnhanced co-operation among co-located stakeholders, gaining access to a wider \nrange of diverse skills and strengths. \n \nLimiting the need for new hydrogen infrastructure, and enabling its shared use \namong a larger group of stakeholders, who also share any risks associated with \nits development.  \nOverall, these benefits result in lower production and transport costs by \nmaximising asset utilisation and enabling economies of scale. Through the \ndevelopment of hydrogen hubs, LAC can progressively scale up low-emissions \nhydrogen production and use, and in parallel create a skilled workforce that can \ngain experience as the sector matures. Rather than targeting gigawatt-scale \nprojects from the outset, as more than 85% of announced projects do, the region \ncould instead identify and develop its first scalable projects in the hundreds of \nmegawatts. This approach would allow the region to avoid making errors \nassociated with over-optimistic expectations (which have been seen elsewhere), \nthereby creating a more sustainable path for hydrogen to play a role in the \neconomy. \nSome countries have already taken the first steps for the development of hydrogen \nhubs and have committed significant funding to this aim, such as the Regional \nClean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) programme in the United States, the Regional \nHydrogen Hubs programme in Australia and the Hydrogen Valley Facility in the \nEuropean Union. Brazil has announced the Pró-Hubs Program, with the first call \nfor proposals expected in 2024. Hydrogen hubs have the potential to help LAC \ncountries accelerate low-emissions hydrogen production and uptake, and some \ncountries are already starting to assess this opportunity. \nFactors to identify the potential for hydrogen hubs \nIdentifying the right locations for hydrogen hubs is fundamental to increasing their \nchances of success. Several factors need to be considered, such as the \navailability of abundant renewable energy resources like solar, wind or \nhydroelectric power. Hub locations should have sufficient electricity transmission \ncapacity and be close to centres of demand. In addition, access to sustainable \nCO2 sources may enable the production of low-emissions hydrocarbon fuels, \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 271  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \ncreating further opportunities. Existing infrastructure and the possible need for \nupgrades can also impact the feasibility of the development of a hydrogen hub. \nThis includes addressing potential bottlenecks in the electricity transmission \nnetwork and extending it where necessary, the availability of natural gas \ninfrastructure and the technical and economic feasibility of repurposing it for \nhydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels, the presence of port facilities and the \npotential need to develop new storage and bunkering capacities at those facilities, \nand the existence of deep-water port terminals for the export of liquefied gases, \nsuch as ammonia. Other social and environmental factors can enable or hinder \nthe successful development of a hub. For example, the availability of water \nresources is crucial, requiring an assessment of freshwater availability to avoid \nconflicts with other users, as well as consideration of the need to develop \ninfrastructure for desalination, distribution and wastewater treatment. \nBy considering all these factors (Figure 8.20), regions can effectively assess and \nidentify the locations potentially best-suited to hydrogen hubs that could make use \nof their natural resources and infrastructure assets to support the deployment of \nlow-emissions hydrogen. This comprehensive approach will ensure that as many \nas possible (if not all) the necessary components are in place to facilitate the first \nhydrogen hubs. \nFigure 8.20 Factors affecting the potential location of hydrogen hubs \n \nThe potential for hydrogen hubs in different locations is influenced by a combination of \nresources, infrastructure and existing and scalable demand, as well as other local factors. \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 272  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nTypes of hydrogen hubs in Latin America and the Caribbean \nThere is no standardised taxonomy to classify the different archetypes of hydrogen \nhubs. For example, the Hydrogen Valleys Platform of Mission Innovation’s Clean \nHydrogen Mission described three archetypes of hydrogen valleys based on their \nsize, the main end-uses for hydrogen considered in each valley, and the potential \nfor exports of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. The development of hydrogen \nhubs can follow different strategies based on resource availability and current and \nfuture demand. Moreover, it is important to note that a hydrogen hub can serve \nmultiple purposes and can evolve over time as the hydrogen market matures. \nBased on the analysis performed in this report, we have defined three potential \nhydrogen hub archetypes that are particularly well suited to the characteristics of \nthe LAC region, and that can help the region to scale up the production and use \nof low-emissions hydrogen in the short and medium term (Figure 8.21). \nHydrogen industrial demand hubs \nGlobally, manufacturing activities that produce, transport and consume large \namounts of energy are typically concentrated in major industrial centres. These \nindustrial centres bring large existing hydrogen demands (in refineries, fertiliser \nplants and chemical plants), which will require low-emissions hydrogen to replace \nunabated fossil-based hydrogen and decarbonise their operations, together with \nother large industrial producers (like steel plants, glass and ceramic \nmanufacturers and other industrial operations that require high-temperature \nheating), for which low-emissions hydrogen can play an important role in replacing \nfossil fuels to abate their GHG emissions. These industrial centres offer a unique \nopportunity for hydrogen demand hubs to emerge nearby and make use of the \nenormous demand that is potentially available. In LAC, many such industrial \ncentres are located in or close to areas with good renewable energy potential, \nwhich could facilitate the production of low-emissions hydrogen near to the end \nusers, thereby limiting the need to develop specific infrastructure, which would be \na costly and lengthy process. Moreover, these hubs can attract additional \nindustries to locate nearby, due to the combination of low-cost renewable energy, \nenabling infrastructure, and essential feedstocks, such as iron ore for near-zero \nemissions steel production or sustainable CO2 for methanol production.  \nThe list below includes some examples of regions in LAC, which – based on their \nindustrial activities, good renewable energy resources and existing infrastructure \n– have the potential to become hydrogen industrial demand hubs: \n \nBrazil: The southeastern and southern regions of Brazil, particularly around Rio \nde Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais, which are all major industrial centres. \nThese areas are home to extensive refining and steelmaking activities. São Paulo \nand Mato Grosso do Sul have significant CO2 resources, and the port of Tubarão \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 273  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nin Espírito Santo, which is one of the world's largest iron ore export terminals, \noffers potential for the export of HBI. \n \nColombia: The areas around Cartagena and Barranquilla have relevant industrial \nactivity, particularly oil refining, ammonia production and fertiliser manufacturing. \nBarranquilla also has an ammonia receiving terminal at its port. The region has \nstrong potential for renewable energy. \n \nMexico: The northeast region, particularly around Nuevo León, which is the \ncountry’s leading region in terms of industrial production. Nuevo León has \nsignificant industrial activity relevant to hydrogen production and use, including oil \nrefining and steel production. The region benefits from good renewable energy \npotential in neighbouring Tamaulipas, and has the potential to develop a corridor \nto adjacent states such as San Luis Potosí and Guanajuato, which also have \nsteelmaking and refining activities. \n \nChile: The Antofagasta region, located in the Atacama Desert, offers high solar \nirradiation potential, i.e. low-cost solar PV electricity. The region's proximity to \ndomestic demand areas, including the mining sector, and already existing \ninfrastructure, including port terminals, desalination plants and railway access, \nfacilitate the potential for hydrogen production and export. \n \nArgentina: Bahía Blanca has potential as a hydrogen hub due to its industrial port \nwith an ammonia plant using natural gas. It is located in an area with strong wind \nconditions and carbon sources from existing industries that could be used for \nhydrogen-based fuels. \nHydrogen bunkering and distribution hubs \nMajor ports and airports are expected to play an important role in the scale-up of \nproduction and use of low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. They \nwill be particularly well positioned to become hubs focused on the storage and \nbunkering of these fuels, which could support the decarbonisation of shipping and \naviation activities, and also enable trade of low-emissions hydrogen-based fuels \nas global markets develop.  \nMany ports and airports in LAC have access to low-cost renewable energy and \nabundant feedstocks of sustainable CO2, meaning that demand in shipping and \naviation is located in places with strong potential to produce low-emissions jet fuel, \nmethanol and ammonia for the decarbonisation of these activities. In Mexico, \nplans have been announced to offer hydrogen-based fuel for bunkering at the port \nof Salinas Cruz, Oaxaca. This initiative is linked to the Interoceanic Corridor of the \nIsthmus of Tehuantepec, which aims to link the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, \nincreasing the role of their ports. In addition, the nearby refinery could become a \nmajor user of hydrogen in the future, further enhancing the strategic importance \nof the port. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 274  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nOther major ports in the region, which are part of today’s major transport corridors, \nmay not be able to count on world-class resources for the production of low-\nemissions hydrogen-based fuels, or may have limited space available for \nproduction. However, they can still act as distribution clusters, importing low-\nemissions hydrogen-based fuels from other regions, storing and bunkering these \nfuels for ships, or enabling their global trade. A clear example is Panama, which \ntoday accounts for one-quarter of all fuel used for international bunkering in LAC, \ngiven the importance of the Panama Canal, and has set targets for the provision \nof hydrogen-based fuels for bunkering through 2050. \nHydrogen supply hubs \nThere are several regions across LAC that have extraordinary renewable energy \npotential and sufficient space to accommodate large-scale generation, but are \nrelatively remote, with limited industrial demand. Some have access to existing \nport infrastructure or could develop it in a relatively short space of time. These \nareas could provide a great opportunity to develop hydrogen supply hubs with a \nfocus on the production of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels for export, either \nto other LAC countries or to global markets once they develop. In some areas, \naccess to sustainable CO2 could further enhance competitiveness in the \nproduction of low-emissions carbon-based fuels. Initially, these hubs would focus \non the production of low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels for export. \nAs the market matures and infrastructure development progresses, hubs of this \nkind could eventually attract energy-intensive industries to the regions, leveraging \nthe abundant renewable energy resources, leading to the creation of jobs and \nwealth. \nMagallanes in Chile, La Guajira in Colombia, or Ceará (through the Port of Pecém) \nand Pernambuco (Port of Suape) in Brazil each combine excellent renewable \nenergy potential (particularly onshore and offshore wind) with limited industrial \nactivity, and are excellent examples of regions that could become hydrogen supply \nhubs. Brazil is building the Transnordestina railroad, a rail network that will connect \nthe ports of Pecém and Suape to the state of Piauí, facilitating the transport of iron \nore and fertilisers, among other commodities, and improving the regions' logistical \ncapabilities. \nUruguay could also become an example, thanks to its strong renewable energy \npotential, experience in handling large shares of variable renewable energy in the \nmatrix, and available CO2 from the pulp and paper industry. However, the \nremoteness of some of these regions often means they encompass vast natural \nareas that require protection. Moreover, many of them are home to indigenous \ncommunities, which brings additional social considerations when assessing the \nopportunities and challenges of developing hydrogen hubs in these regions. \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 275  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nFigure 8.21 Potential first hydrogen hubs in Latin America and the Caribbean \n \nSeveral hydrogen hubs could emerge in LAC for different purposes, such as industrial \ndemand aggregation hubs, bunkering hubs or supply hubs in more remote areas. \nThese hub types provide a framework for understanding the different roles that \nhydrogen hubs can play. They highlight the flexible and dynamic nature of \nhydrogen hubs, which can adapt and expand their functions as technologies and \nmarkets evolve. \nNear-term actions to foster first hydrogen hubs \nPolicy makers have a critical role to play in enabling the emergence of hydrogen \nhubs given the absence of a market and limited low-emissions supply. In this \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 276  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nsection, we consider essential areas for policy action, looking at the current status \nof each area, its relevance, challenges and alternatives for policy makers. \nCertification \nCertifying hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels (as well as the end-products \nmanufactured with them) is fundamental for LAC countries, given the focus on \nexports and need for emissions accounting as hydrogen crosses borders. LAC \ncountries will also need to ensure interoperability between their schemes and \nthose of the export markets, and to understand how such requirements can be \nadapted to the local context. Certification is also essential when considering \nhydrogen derivatives and carbon-based fuels, due to the additional conversion \nsteps and requirement for CO2. In the LAC context, as the market matures, a \ncritical feature of certification will be the inclusion of sustainability attributes \nbeyond GHG emissions, to cover aspects such as land use, water consumption \nand social impacts. \nThe region is not starting from scratch (see Chapter 6. Policies). Brazil is \ndeveloping a voluntary certification scheme and has defined a GHG threshold of \n7 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 for low-emissions hydrogen, as well as a preliminary \ngovernance structure and roles for government agencies. This is higher than the \n3.4 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 defined for renewable hydrogen in the European Union145 \nand the 4 kg CO2- eq/kg H2 defined for clean hydrogen in the United States. \nColombia has defined different types of hydrogen and has suggested the \nintroduction of a certification scheme, with initial efforts on certification emerging \nfrom a voluntary scheme spearheaded by the private sector, which is currently \nunder development. Chile is developing a support study that will inform the design \nof its own certification scheme. The region is already striving for harmonisation. At \nCOP 28, 14 LAC countries endorsed a regional certification scheme (CertHiLAC) \nthat is consistent with international standards, but considers the specificities of the \nregion. At the international level, Antigua and Barbuda, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay \nand Uruguay endorsed the declaration of intent for the mutual recognition of \ncertification schemes launched at COP 28, which seeks to facilitate mutual \nrecognition and to use the ISO Technical Specification to drive standardisation \nacross countries. The Netherlands, together with Chile and Uruguay, have \nassessed the local conditions for compliance with EU regulation for hydrogen \nderivatives, extending beyond GHG emissions to cover water and social criteria \nas well. Findings include that Uruguay and Chile can be each considered as a \nsingle bidding zone, which means no efforts are needed to demonstrate \ncompliance with the geographical correlation criterion in the regulation, but \nadditional work would be needed to translate this concept to more LAC countries. \n \n \n145 The standard for the European Union is well-to-wheel, while the standards for Brazil and the United States are well-to-\ngate (a smaller scope than well-to-wheel). \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 277  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nBoth countries can use the guarantees of origin scheme in place for the renewable \ninput for hydrogen. Chile is expected to be a high water stressed-region, and \nensuring compliance with the social standards might require further efforts. \nThe next step for LAC countries is to provide more detail on the certification \nschemes and how to operationalise them. This means going from definitions of \nterms to specific rules for GHG accounting, boundary definitions, criteria for \nenergy and material input, links with incentives, and clarity on how these rules will \nchange over time (if at all), as has been done in other regions. This is essential for \nproject developers, who need clarity on the criteria they will need to navigate and \non whether they will need to comply with multiple schemes (since many of the \nprojects announced are targeted for export), which would also provide better long-\nterm visibility on the financial outlook for their projects. LAC countries should \nensure consistency not only with the schemes from large importers, but also with \nthe ISO Technical Specification. This would facilitate mutual recognition of \ncertificates and allow a certain level of interoperability with other markets. \nMost schemes and initial efforts have focused on hydrogen as a final product. Yet \nas we show in this chapter, the production of hydrogen derivatives represents an \nopportunity to capture more value from the supply chain, to develop domestic \nindustry, and to increase the overall macroeconomic benefit. Certification \nschemes should, therefore, also work towards broadening their scope to include \nhydrogen derivatives, ensuring consistency with parallel efforts for various \ncommodities (e.g. steel), as well as for the CO2 input in case of carbon-derived \nfuels. \nLAC countries could also consider how incentives align with certification schemes. \nSeveral LAC countries have tax incentives in place, but so far, there is little \ncorrelation between the GHG mitigation provided by projects and the incentives \nthey are eligible for. This will be especially important to consider as the market \nscales up.  \nOpportunities for national oil companies \nNational oil companies (NOC) in LAC have ambitious decarbonisation plans, large \nannual investment budgets, and a skilled labour force that could be transferred to \nclean technologies like hydrogen. They operate the refineries that use hydrogen \nat large scale today, and which produce oil derivatives that are used by the \npetrochemical industry, which will also need to transition to low-emissions \nhydrogen. This provides an opportunity to build on existing relationships with other \nstakeholders in LAC’s industrial demand hubs to unlock synergies in hydrogen \nsupply, and in infrastructure planning and development. NOC also have close ties \nto national governments and have a large share of national gas production. All \nthese factors put them in a unique position to make investments in low-emissions  \n \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 278  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nhydrogen, allowing them to develop experience and become frontrunners in this \narea, and to diversify their portfolios by tapping into a new market with different \nprice dynamics (to oil and gas). \nThe region’s NOC could leverage their substantial balance sheets to venture into \nhydrogen development, and some are already doing so. Brazil, Colombia and \nMexico have the largest NOC in the region, with combined assets worth almost \nUSD 350 billion and average annual investments of USD 26-45 billion in the past \ncouple of years. To give a sense of the magnitude of these numbers, satisfying \nthe entire current hydrogen demand in LAC with renewable hydrogen would \nrequire an investment in the order of USD 95-100 billion (including for the \nrenewables assets). \nNOC could also tap into newly issued debt and equity. With regards to debt, one \nchallenge for NOC is that their bonds are not investment grade, which would limit \naccess to international debt markets, so they would need to rely on domestic \npublic funds. Furthermore, existing liabilities and interest repayment can present \nchallenges for acquiring new debt (e.g. total debt for Pemex [Mexico] was over \nUSD 105 billion in 2023, equivalent to 5.6% of national GDP, and most of it in hard \ncurrency). This still leaves open the possibility to raise new equity. For example, \nPetrobras (Brazil) had a market valuation of over USD 100 billion at the end of \n2023. \nDemand creation measures \nPolicy makers have several available tools to help create a market for low-\nemissions hydrogen, such as measures that target volume or price. One is in the \nform of regulation, such as quotas for specific applications. While there are no \nquotas legislated yet, some LAC countries have introduced sectoral targets that \ngo in this direction. For example, Colombia has proposed a 40% target for low-\nemissions hydrogen in the industrial sector (for existing applications) in its \nhydrogen strategy and Panama has a target of 5% of bunkering supply being from \nhydrogen derivatives (for new applications). Demand-side incentives will be \nneeded in order to achieve these targets. \nWhile most LAC countries have an explicit target for hydrogen production or \nelectrolyser capacity, there are few examples of targets for end-use sectors. One \nreason for this is the focus on exports rather than domestic demand, which means \nthat the development of the domestic hydrogen industry is dependent on uptake \nin other regions and the emergence of a global market. To reduce this risk, a \nphased approach for the development of the hydrogen industry could be used, \nstarting with domestic demand. Many strategies already consider this approach, \nwhich should be carried through into implementation. Where already in place, \ntargets for the demand side should be translated into specific laws or incentives. \nFor example, Argentina, Chile and Colombia have set targets for end-use \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 279  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \napplications in their strategies. The next step would be to identify the concrete \nactions, funding programmes or laws that would be needed to increase the \nchances of achieving those targets. Similarly, several LAC countries have tax \nincentives in place (see Chapter 6. Policies), but all these incentives are related \nto electrolysers (i.e. the supply side). There are no examples of equivalent tax \nincentives for the demand side. This is an area where learning from international \npractices (e.g. the ReFuelEU regulation in the European Union, which sets \nspecific targets and milestone years for hydrogen-derived fuels in aviation, or \nH2Hubs in the United States) would be useful. An approach that seeks a balance \nbetween supply-side and demand-side incentives could help trigger domestic \ndemand and promote a shift of existing applications to low-emissions hydrogen. \nAn advantage of the hydrogen hubs approach is the natural demand aggregation \nand synergistic effects of multiple users. While many stakeholders within the same \ngeographical areas already interact, hydrogen hubs also bring in new actors like \nproject developers, equipment manufacturers, infrastructure and port operators. \nPolicy makers could facilitate the emergence of new projects and hubs by setting \nup platforms where these different actors can connect (see Box 2.2). This is \nalready happening to some extent through national hydrogen associations, and \nregionally through H2LAC, but public platforms that both connect stakeholders \nand provide an overview of the incentives in place and the administrative \nprocesses to follow, with a single point of contact, would facilitate project \ndevelopment. Governments could also explore the option of using state owned \nenterprises (SOEs) – particularly NOC – as demand aggregators. SOEs could \nlaunch calls for tenders for low-emissions hydrogen (and derivatives) and issue \nlong-term contracts for purchasing them at a fixed price, which could provide \nofftake certainty (a key risk preventing projects from moving ahead – see Box 3.1) \nand contribute to price discovery and transparency. The hydrogen (and its \nderivatives) purchased could then be sold to a larger pool of potential domestic \nend users, as aggregating demand enables economies of scale that individual \ncompanies would find difficult to achieve if they purchased separately. The \ngovernment of India is currently piloting this procedure with the Solar Energy \nCorporation of India (see Chapter 2. Hydrogen demand), \nLong-term planning \nEnabling infrastructure is an essential requirement for hubs development. At the \nsame time, some infrastructures, like gas, hydrogen, or electricity transmission \nnetworks, are natural monopolies, which means public regulation is needed for \ntheir operation and financial viability. Policy makers could incorporate hydrogen in \nthe long-term planning for critical infrastructure (see Figure 8.20), especially as \nthese assets typically have long lead times that are expected to be rapidly \noutpaced by the growth in hydrogen flows. For example, high-voltage power lines \ncan take more than 8 years to build, and gas pipelines (which could provide an \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 280  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nindicator for hydrogen pipelines) can take 6 to 12 years to build. In contrast, should \nall the announced projects materialise, hydrogen production in LAC countries \nwould nearly triple in less than 6 years. Power transmission lines are especially \ncritical given the potential mismatch between those sites with good renewable \nresources and the existing grid. Long-term planning needs are not limited to \nenergy infrastructure: For hydrogen supply hubs in remote areas, road and \ntransport infrastructure, water and waste management facilities, and health and \neducation facilities for workers and their families will also be critical. \nPolicy makers need to carry out integrated planning across networks. For \nexample, bunkering of hydrogen-derived fuels requires not only port expansion \nand storage facilities, but also co-ordination with upstream infrastructure to ensure \na reliable and steady supply. Similarly, as renewable hydrogen scales up, the \neffect of electrolysers on electricity demand, and their potential role in providing \nflexibility, means the electricity system will be more tightly integrated with other \ncommodities, and will require integrated system planning. \nBeyond planning measures, regulation of hydrogen pipelines is not yet in place. \nDefining the standards and regulations that these assets would need to comply \nwith, the methodology for tariff-setting, and the conditions for network access \nwould provide clarity for projects aiming to use them (see Chapter 4. Trade and \ninfrastructure). \nPolicy makers can also accelerate the development of hydrogen projects by \nshortening the times needed for the various planning processes like environmental \nimpact assessment, permit application and examination, and grid connection, \namong others. This includes ensuring there are enough qualified staff in the \nrelevant government agencies to process a growing number of applications, and \nreducing the need for project developers to undertake multiple processes in \nparallel with different agencies. For example, a successful model applied for \nrenewables deployment in Europe and the Middle East has been to undertake \nenvironmental assessments in dedicated areas, and then provide clearance for \nindividual projects to skip this step in those areas. A pre-assessment of this kind \ncould cover not only environmental aspects, but also community engagement to \nensure that the local community is aware of the benefits of projects even before \nspecific projects are identified. In LAC, Iberdrola Brazil is creating a biodiversity \ncorridor connecting forest and permanent conservation areas, for example. \nSocial acceptance \nMany projects are expected to be developed in remote regions, often in natural \nprotected areas with a strong presence of indigenous communities, which account \nfor around 8% of the population in LAC. Low-emissions hydrogen projects would \noccupy a significant amount of land, not only for the renewable energy generation \nassets, but also for the enabling infrastructure, which may cross different \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 281  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \njurisdictions. Engaging with local and indigenous communities is of primary \nimportance to ensure that projects offer them socio-economic benefits, including \nthe creation of jobs and the improvement of their livelihoods.  \nFailure to incorporate the voices of these groups at the early stages of planning \ncould become a barrier to the development of hydrogen projects. Clean energy \nprojects are already facing opposition from local communities in the region, who \nhave raised concerns about the lack of consultation, the need for assessment of \nenvironmental and social impacts, and a lack of understanding of policy makers \nand project developers of the relationship between communities and their lands. \nNotably, several renewable energy projects in the Colombian Guajira have been \nhalted, partly due to conflicts with local communities. Permitting delays due to \ncommunity acceptance concerns have resulted in projects under development in \nthe region being deferred by up to 3 years. In the case of hydrogen, challenges to \nsocial acceptance are already arising in regions more advanced in the production \nand uptake of low-emissions hydrogen, such as Europe (see Box 3.1). LAC \ngovernments should incorporate lessons learnt by governments that have already \ntaken these first steps, in order to avoid repeating mistakes that are now resulting \nin project delays. \nWith regards to the protection of indigenous territories, adherence to the free, prior \nand informed consent process is crucial. This is a legal mechanism derived from \nthe International Labour Organization Convention, and ratified by most countries \nin LAC, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. \nThe consultation process used to obtain consent, while not always implemented, \nis essential to ensuring that the rights and interests of indigenous communities are \nrespected and that they are fully informed and involved in decision-making \nprocesses. Governments have a key role in implementing these consultation \nprocesses, which should happen in early stages of the project to ensure there is \nenough time to survey concerns and incorporate action into the project planning. \nPolicy makers can define how this process should be undertaken, who should be \ninvolved (such as government at national, regional and local levels, government \narms-length agencies, private developers, civil society groups and representatives \nof the local communities), and how to co-ordinate the different stakeholders \ninvolved to ensure a robust but streamlined procedure, as well as how to assess \nhow hydrogen projects could impact local communities.  \nBringing down the cost of capital \nThe cost of capital is critical to the cost of producing renewable \nhydrogen \nUnlike fossil-based hydrogen production, renewable hydrogen does not have any \nfuel costs – all the major costs, including the electricity price and electrolyser, are \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 282  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \ncapital costs. The only recurring costs are the operation and maintenance costs \nof the renewable electricity source and the electrolyser, which are in the order of l \n1-2% of CAPEX for solar PV, 2-3% of CAPEX for onshore wind and 3% for the \nelectrolyser. This means that how the initial capital is financed has a critical effect \non the cost of production. Yet the cost of capital is higher in emerging economies \nthan developed ones. For solar PV and electricity storage, the cost of capital, in \nnominal terms, is on average 4-7% points higher for emerging economies. In \nabsolute terms, the cost of capital for solar PV, for example, was 10.5-12% in \nBrazil and Mexico in 2022, compared to 4.1-5.2% in Germany and the \nNetherlands. \nThis can make a big difference to the levelised cost of hydrogen production (Figure \n8.22): A difference of six percentage points can result in a cost premium of about \nUSD 1/kg H2. Assuming that the cost of capital is 4% for renewables in developed \nmarkets, Latin American countries with better quality renewable resources could \nfind that this advantage is undermined if the cost of capital is higher by 4-8 \npercentage points. Moreover, this is without considering the additional conversion \nsteps and efficiency losses necessary to export the hydrogen from LAC. If these \ncosts are also taken into account, the differential in cost of capital would need to \nbe reduced further in order to reach a breakeven point. \nFigure 8.22 Impact of cost of capital on hydrogen production costs in Latin America \nand the Caribbean vs Europe in the Announced Pledges Scenario, 2030 \n \nIEA. CC BY 4.0. \nNotes: LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; LCOH = levelised cost of hydrogen; RE = renewable energy. For Europe, \na cost of capital of 4% is used. A technology risk premium of 2% is assumed for the electrolyser. \nA cost of capital premium of 4-8 percentage points could result in higher hydrogen \nproduction costs in LAC than in advanced economies, despite better quality renewable \nresources. \n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n12%\n14%\n16%\nLCOH (USD/kg H₂)\nWeighted average cost of capital (%)\nLAC - Financial cost\nLAC - CAPEX\nLAC - OPEX\nEurope - Good RE\nresources\nEurope - Moderate RE\nresources\nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 283  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nMultiple types of risks affect the cost of capital \nThere are two types of risks that drive up the costs of hydrogen projects in LAC. \nThose specific to hydrogen, such as technology, infrastructure and offtake, and \nthose which are country-related (and applicable to any clean technology project), \nsuch as macroeconomic, policy and regulatory risks or social acceptance. How \nrelevant these risks are will depend on the national context, but country-related \nrisks could dominate the cost of capital. This is especially true in countries where \npolitical instability or potential regulatory changes decrease the certainty and \nvisibility that investors have for future project cash flows and returns on \ninvestment. A credit guarantee can be an effective way to mitigate political risk, \nboth in terms of decreasing the cost of capital (with a more pronounced effect for \ncountries considered riskier) and increasing the mobilisation ratio of public and \nprivate capital (30-100 times) with capital that might not need to be disbursed. For \nexample, for a renewable hydrogen project using solar PV in Namibia, a political \nrisk guarantee (covering non-payment of loans and bonds caused by political \nevents) could reduce the cost of capital by almost 4 percentage points, a revenue \nguarantee146 could reduce the cost of capital by 3.5 percentage points, and a \nperformance guarantee147 by another 0.5 percentage points. \nRisks also depend on the specific stage of project development. For example, due \nto the absence of a hydrogen market, securing offtake with a suitable price point, \nfor the entire capacity of the project, and over as long a term as possible, is the \nmost critical measure for addressing the volume and price risk. Beyond securing \nthe hydrogen purchase agreement, reducing risk is also influenced by the \ncredibility of the counterparty, who should ideally have a track record in the country \nand project development experience. In contrast, post-FID, completion risks are \nthe most relevant, especially for first-of-a-kind plants where unforeseen factors \ncan lead to cost overruns and delay in project execution. Some of the options to \nmitigate this risk are an engineering, procurement and construction wrap, in which \nthere is a single construction contract with the main contractor who is responsible \nfor the sub-contracts for specific packages, or a completion warranty, where there \nis a financial contract paid out in full upon completion of the plant on time and on \nbudget. \nStrategies for reducing the cost of capital \nThe capital structure of a project is defined by the shares of equity and debt. These \ntwo types of capital have different risk and return profiles, which result in the cost \nof equity being higher than the cost of debt. They also have different capital \n \n \n146 This can mitigate the offtake risk and reduce payment volatility, thereby increasing the certainty of the cashflow needed \nto repay the investment and provide a return on investment. \n147 This can be issued by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to guarantee the performance of a technology within \nagreed key performance indicators (KPIs). \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 284  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nproviders. The average cost of capital considers the share of these types of \ncapital. Since each has a different risk profile, different mechanisms can be used \nto reduce each type of capital. Projects can be financed from the balance sheet of \ncompanies, in which case the company credit record is exposed to the project \nperformance but debt can be secured at a lower cost, or through project finance, \nwhere the cost of capital is evaluated based on the project cashflows and equity \nfrom the companies is not exposed to project failure. \nGovernments can use different strategies to bring down the cost of capital at \ndifferent stages of project development. While overall strategies and integration in \nlong-term planning can be the most relevant factors at the conceptual stage, a \nclear regulatory framework is critical at the feasibility stage. Financial measures \nsuch as grants, concessional loans, tax incentives or mezzanine instruments are \nalso important when the profitability of the project is being assessed prior to FID. \nGuarantee of property rights, consistency of legal framework, tax and incentive \nstability are critical for the operational phase. \nFinancial measures used by governments have varying degrees of effectiveness \nin mitigating risks relating to the cost of capital and mobilising additional capital. \nFor example, grants and tax incentives directly decrease the cost for the private \nsector but are limited and not fiscally sustainable (since there is no capital \nreturn).148 A grant could reduce the share of equity, thereby reducing the overall \ncost of capital (since the cost of equity is higher). Concessional loans decrease \nthe cost of debt and improve fiscal stability, but may have a smaller effect on the \ncost of capital for the first few projects that could be financed with higher shares \nof equity, due to the higher risk. \nNon-financial instruments can also be used to reduce risks, such as streamlined \npermitting processes, as have been initiated in Chile, and the provision of clear \nenvironmental assessment guidelines. Additionally, governments have an \nessential role in facilitating early communication with and participation of \ncommunities affected by hydrogen projects.  \nDevelopment Finance Institutions (DFI) also have different tools at their disposal \nto decrease the cost of capital. Project financing tools include de-risking \nmechanisms such as credit guarantees, equity co-investments and preferential \nfinance in the form of concessional finance, blended finance, or finance in local \ncurrency. Other tools include support for knowledge sharing, capacity building and \ntechnical assistance in policy and regulatory design, as well as standard-setting \ntools such as sectoral lending strategies and environmental and social \nframeworks. DFIs can also facilitate strong offtake agreements by improving the \n \n \n148 A 1-GW of electrolysis project could cost USD 3-4 billion to satisfy the equivalent of half of the current hydrogen demand \nin Colombia or Chile today with that project alone representing close to 1% of the GDP. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8. Latin America in focus \nPAGE | 285  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nfinancial and technical strength of the sponsors or support infrastructure \ndevelopment or access to shared infrastructure. For example, in LAC, the World \nBank provides technical assistance for hydrogen projects to Argentina, Brazil, \nColombia, Costa Rica and Panama, and concessional finance including \nUSD 150 million for Chile (approved in FY23), USD 135 million for Brazil (for \napproval in FY24), and potentially Colombia as well (under discussion). The \nInternational Finance Corporation has six approved engagements in LAC, \nincluding renewable hydrogen for storage (Barbados, USD 155 million), fertiliser \n(Colombia, USD 106 million), road transport (Costa Rica) and methanol (Mexico). \nThe Inter-American Development Bank has also provided extensive technical \nassistance for strategy development, feasibility and market studies to Chile, \nColombia, Brazil, Mexico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uruguay. \nIn Chile, a “Green Hydrogen Facility” will provide USD 1 billion of private and \npublic funds to provide CAPEX support and risk mitigation, with the expectation of \nmobilising USD 12.5 billion in total. In Brazil, the Climate Investment Fund has \ngranted USD 70 million of funding to the industrial and port complex in Pecém to \nbuild shared hydrogen infrastructure and an innovation centre for renewable \nhydrogen. \nIn the private sector, strategies to decrease the cost of capital could include \nrecourse financing. Even though this entails risks for the company behind the \nproject, potentially impacting its creditworthiness, it could lead to a lower cost of \ndebt or longer tenor. Given the higher risk associated with early projects, higher \nshares of corporate finance are expected in the early stages of market \ndevelopment, with a transition to project finance characteristic of renewables or \ninfrastructure projects as the market matures. Learning from deployment, as well \nas standardisation of the design, modular design, and manufacturing excellence \ncan all help to facilitate future replication and avoid delays and cost overruns \nintroduced by tailored projects. An example is the pilot phase of the Haru Oni \nproject by HIF Global in Chile for a 1.2 MW electrolyser using wind power and \nbiogenic CO2 to produce synthetic fuels starting with e-gasoline (to be exported to \nGermany), and potentially expanding to SAF and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). \nOfftake risk was tackled by an offtake agreement with Porsche, and the technology \nand investment risks were reduced by involving a consortium of companies \nspecialised in different steps of the process.149 Project finance was used, and the \nproject is owned by HIF Global which is a US holding company for equity financing, \nwith local subsidiaries that can raise debt. The pilot phase was financed with \nUSD 260 million of capital increase by the holding company, USD 50 million of \nequity, and USD 10 million as a grant from the German government. \n \n \n149 Enel Green Power for the renewable electricity supply, Global Thermostat for the CO2 supply, Exxon Mobil for the \nmethanol-to-gasoline technology (which was built by Sinopec), and Siemens energy for the supply chain integration \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nChapter 8.

One of the first steps to decrease \nthe cost of capital is to move more projects beyond FID.

CC BY 4.0. \nAnnex \nExplanatory notes \nProjections and estimates \nProjections and estimates in this Global Hydrogen Review 2024 are based on \nresearch and modelling results derived from the most recent data and information \navailable from governments, institutions, companies and other sources as of \nAugust 2024. \nTerminology relating to low-emissions hydrogen  \nIn this report, low-emissions hydrogen includes hydrogen which is produced \nthrough water electrolysis with electricity generated from a low-emission source \n(renewables, e.g. solar, wind turbines or nuclear). Hydrogen produced from \nbiomass or from fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) \ntechnology is also counted as low-emissions hydrogen.  \nProduction from fossil fuels with CCUS is included only if upstream emissions are \nsufficiently low, if capture – at high rates – is applied to all CO2 streams associated \nwith the production route, and if all CO2 is permanently stored to prevent its release \ninto the atmosphere. The same principle applies to low-emissions feedstocks and \nhydrogen-based fuels made using low-emission hydrogen and a sustainable \ncarbon source (of biogenic origin or directly captured from the atmosphere). \nThe IEA does not use colours to refer to the different hydrogen production routes. \nHowever, when referring to specific policy announcements, programmes, \nregulations and projects where an authority uses colours (e.g. “green” hydrogen), \nor terms such as “clean” or “low-carbon” to define a hydrogen production route, \nwe have retained these categories for the purpose of reporting developments in \nthis review. \nTerminology for carbon capture, utilisation and storage \nIn this report, CCUS includes CO2 captured for use (CCU) as well as for storage \n(CCS), including CO2 that is both used and stored, e.g. for enhanced oil recovery \nor building materials, if some or all of the CO2 is permanently stored. When use of \nthe CO2 ultimately leads to it being re-emitted to the atmosphere, e.g. in urea \nproduction, CCU is specified. \nGlobal Hydrogen Review 2024 \nAnnex \nPAGE | 288  \nI EA. CC BY 4.0. \nScenarios used in this Global Hydrogen Review \nThis Global Hydrogen Review relies on two scenarios to track progress on \nhydrogen production and use: \n \nThe Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) explores how the energy system would \nevolve if current policy settings are retained. These include the latest policy \nmeasures adopted by governments around the world but do not assume that \naspirational or economy-wide targets will be met unless they are backed up with \ndetail on how they are to be achieved. \n \nThe Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), illustrates the extent to which \nannounced ambitions and targets can deliver the emissions reductions needed to \nachieve net zero emissions by 2050. It includes all major national announcements, \nboth 2030 targets and longer-term net zero or carbon neutrality pledges, \nregardless of whether these announcements have been anchored in legislation or \nin updated Nationally Determined Contributions \n \nThe Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) is a normative scenario \nthat sets out a pathway to stabilise global average temperatures at 1.5°C above \npre-industrial levels. The NZE Scenario achieves global net zero energy sector \nCO2 emissions by 2050 without relying on emissions reductions from outside the \nenergy sector. \nProject status \nFor the analysis of the pipeline of announced, four potential statuses have been \nconsidered: \n \nOperational: includes projects that are already producing hydrogen, even if they \nwere in a ramp up period and had not achieve their full production capacity. \n \nFinal investment decision: includes projects that have started construction or that \nhave taken a firm investment decision. \n \nFeasibility studies: includes projects that are undertaking pre-feasibility studies, \nfeasibility studies or front-end engineering design.  \n \nEarly stage: includes projects at very early stages of development, e.g. only a co-\noperation agreement among stakeholders has been announced or a general \nannouncement of the intention to develop a project has been made. \nCurrency conversions \nThis report provides the stated values of programmes and projects in the currency \nstated in their announcement. These values, in many instances, are converted to \nUS dollars for ease of comparison. The currency exchange rates used correspond \nto an average value for the year of the announcement based on World Bank \nexchange rates.
